\nThe development team needs sample data to help maintain the import scripts.

For those that support direct database import (b2, MT, WP), that means a MySQL dump of the relevant tables.

For file-based importers (Blogger, and anything else that supports the MT export file format), we need sample export files.

Ideally, we're looking for samples that are brief enough to check by hand, but long enough to demonstrate all the tricky things that might occur in the real world. A handful of short posts with examples of the following would be perfect:

* Plain text
* HTML markup
* HTML entities
* non-English characters
* Categories
* Multiple authors
* Comments
* Any other special features or content that might apply to articles or content

You can dump a copy of your database using phpMyAdmin or mysqldump.

Please post on the "testing forum":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewforum.php?id=31 if you can help.

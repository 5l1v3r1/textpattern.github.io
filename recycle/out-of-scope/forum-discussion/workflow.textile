\nWhile Textpattern's admin system allows for 6 levels of user priveledges, you could broadly divide 'users' into 2 categories.

* The developer (?)
* The client (end user? publisher?)

(The same person could play both roles)

* Developer will spend most time in 'Presentation'
* Client will spend most time in 'Content'

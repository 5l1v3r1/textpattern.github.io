These instructions describe how to move (more accurately, duplicate) a remotely-hosted Web site powered by Textpattern to a local computer with an Apache Web server. One might consider doing this in the situation when a live Web site was created without first establishing a local development site; hence, moving a copy of a live site to a local server will provide a convenient development platform (as well as another source of backup) for a live site.

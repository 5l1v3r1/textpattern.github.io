h1. File download link

h2. Syntax

bc. <txp:file_download_link />

The *file_download_link* tag is both a _single_ tag and a _container_ tag. Thus it may be used as an opening and closing pair:

bc. <txp:file_download_link>
    ...containing statements...
</txp:file_download_link>

When used as a single tag, Textpattern will replace the tag with a download link to the file being downloaded. As a container, it will assign the link to the given text or tag, while the single tag outputs the file's plain URL.

h2. Attributes

Tag will accept the following attributes (*case-sensitive*):

; [[filename]]=&quot;text&quot;
: Specifies which file to display by its @filename@ as shown on the [[Files]] page.
; [[id]]=&quot;integer&quot;
: Specifies the @id@, assigned at upload of the file, to display. Can be found on the [[Files]] page.

p(alert-block information). Note: @id@ takes precedence over @filename@. If neither is defined and the tag is not used within the context of a file, nothing is returned.

h2. Examples

bc. <txp:file_download_link id="4">
    <txp:file_download_name />
    [<txp:file_download_size format="mb" decimals="2" />]
</txp:file_download_link>

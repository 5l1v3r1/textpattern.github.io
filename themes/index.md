# Textpattern themes

Front-side and admin-side themes are available in Textpattern. This page is your waypoint for getting started.

## Themes website

There is a new themes site coming. Few details are available at this point, but presumably it will be a mecca for finding and sharing front-side and admin-side Textpattern themes.

[Follow along with site development](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern-themes-website).

## Front-end themes

With the arrival of Textpattern 4.7 comes new core theming functionality for the front-end:

* [Front-end themes](https://docs.textpattern.com/themes/front-end-themes)
* [Themes panel](https://docs.textpattern.com/administration/themes-panel) (administration doc)
* [Textpattern gains Themes support](https://textpattern.com/weblog/403/textpattern-cms-gains-themes-support) (developer overview on theme functionality)

## Admin-side themes

Admin-side themes are handled differently to front-side themes and were created prior to Textpattern 4.7:

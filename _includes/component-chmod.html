A lot of people have trouble setting a chmod value of 755 or 711, thus needing to use a chmod of 777, which has [security implications](https://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=26613). The discrepancy is due to how Apache directives are configured on the web server, meaning a server administrator or web host may need to intervene and change the directives. If a web host won't do it, think about finding a new web host, because no web host should force you to operate your site insecurely.

h1. Where are the installation instructions? [todo]

The installation instructions on the "download page":/download/ are brief but accurate.

There are some "step-by-step instructions":http://textbook.textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Detailed_Installation_Instructions at "Textbook":http://textbook.textpattern.net/.

Make sure you have the following _before_ trying to install Textpattern:

# The name of a MySQL *database*.
# A *username* and *password* that is sufficient to access the database.
# The *hostname* for your MySQL server.  This is almost always @localhost@.

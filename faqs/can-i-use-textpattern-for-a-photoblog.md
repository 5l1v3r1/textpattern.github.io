h1. Can I use Textpattern for a photoblog? [todo]

Sure.  Textpattern has an "Article image":https://textpattern.com/faq/109/article_images-arent-working feature, which lets you attach a photo to each article.

All you need to do is use an article form that includes the @<txp:article_image />@ tag.  Each time you want to post a new image, create a new article with the image attached.

You can manage the images themselves using Textpattern's image upload feature, or upload them yourself using FTP if you'd prefer.

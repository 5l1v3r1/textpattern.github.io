h1. What kind of websites does Textpattern do best? [todo]

We receive many questions about Textpattern's strengths and limitations.  Textpattern is best suited for websites that require several - though not necessarily all - of the following features:

* News or Weblog-style chronological articles, perhaps organized into several distinct departments or sections.
* Groups of articles organized by other means, like a FAQ, product catalogue or portfolio.
* Single "static" pages, like an About or Contact page.
* Images; either attached to articles (as in a photoblog), or displayed in a gallery.
* File downloads.
* Structure, presentation and content maintained separately.
* Articles written by authors who don't necessarily know HTML.

In other words, Textpattern is well suited for:

* News, magazine, tutorial and review sites
* Weblogs and photoblogs
* websites for businesses and non-profit organizations
* Online product catalogues
* Portfolio and professional sites
* Simple portals and file download sites

...or any website that includes several of those characteristics.

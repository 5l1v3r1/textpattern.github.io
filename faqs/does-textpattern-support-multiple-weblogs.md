h1. Does Textpattern support multiple weblogs? [todo]

You can achieve the appearance of multiple weblogs using sections - one section per weblog.

If you need complete independence between those weblogs or sites, or want to limit authors' access rights to each weblog, you'll have to use a separate Textpattern installation for each.

There are currently no plans to add multiple weblog support to Textpattern.  We might add support for author access restrictions per section at some point, but there are no concrete plans on how that might work or "when it might be available":https://textpattern.com/faq/90/when-will-the-next-version-be-released.  Help is always welcome.

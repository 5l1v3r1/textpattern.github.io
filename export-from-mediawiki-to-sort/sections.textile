"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:sections-tab.png!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:sections-tab.png

"sections":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=sections are the principle content organization mechanism in Textpattern, and the Sections panel is where you manage them (Figure 1).

Sections essentially provide the ability to create lateral structure in your site, thus each section has its own unique URL if the site is configured to use clean URLs in "basic&#95;preferences":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=basic_preferences.

In the sections panel, you're able to define what "pages":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=pages and "styles":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=styles will be used for the "articles":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=articles published in context to a given section. You can also control if articles posted in that section will be seen on the front page of the site, and whether or not the articles will be used for site searching.

The Sections panel composed of two regions: A top region where you can create new sections, and a bottom region where all existing sections and their respective settings are displayed.

Textpattern includes two sections by default: _About_ and _Articles_.

h3(sectionedit1#section_creation_controls). Section Creation Controls

The top portion of the _Sections_ panel is where you create new sections, and it's composed of three controls (Figure 2).

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:prefs-sections-new.png!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:prefs-sections-new.png

h4(#create_section). Create Section

The first control in the create section form is a text box and Create button where you type a new section name and create it (Figure 2a). Textpattern assigns its default page and style automatically (to ensure baseline publishing capabilities) but you can select differently if you have custom "pages":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=pages and "styles":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=styles already created; these will automatically appear in the assignment dropdown menus both at time of creating a new section and at any time later respective to a given section.

h5(#section_names_to_avoid). Section Names to Avoid

Sections can be given any arbitrary name, except for a few labels already reserved for Textpattern's special functions. Avoid the following or undesirable results will likely occur:

* *author* (or the equivalent in the site's set language)
* *category* (or the equivalent in the site's set language)
* *section* (or the equivalent in the site's set language)
* *atom*
* *file&#95;download*
* *rss*

Section names already assigned to *directories* (and of course vice versa) will not work either.

h4(#page_and_style_assignment). Page and Style Assignment

The next two controls are dropdown lists where you can select a given page and style for your section (Figure 2b and 2c). As noted above, these will be set as defaults unless you select otherwise. You can't select otherwise if you have not yet created custom "pages":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=pages and/or "styles":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=styles.

h3(sectionedit2#section_customization_controls). Section Customization Controls

The rest of the _Sections_ panel is where the existing _Sections_ themselves are listed in alphabetical order. Each has the exact same controls, so we'll describe them by using one of the defaults, the “about” _Section_ (Figure 3).

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:prefs-sections-existing.png!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:prefs-sections-existing.png

h4(#section_name_a). //Section// Name (a)

h4(#section_title_b). //Section// Title (b)

h4(#uses_page_c). Uses //Page// (c)

The Textpattern design encourages maximizing design reuse. It is possible to create a single page for every single section in _Presentation &gt; Pages_. This is a lot of needless work if they all look the same. The Uses Page field is a drop down box listing all the currently known pages. When this section is called, the article tags in that section will be interpreted with this section's context and provide this section's article content.

h4(#uses_style_d). Uses //Style// (d)

Additionally, each section can use a different CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) layout. This box will drop down and list all the currently known styles and lets the designer pick.

h4(#selected_by_default_e). Selected by default? (e)

This really has a bit more to do with authorship than design. In _Content &gt; Write_ there is a field for the section the article should be filed in. This field in _Presentation &gt; Sections_ allows a section name to be highlighted in that field automatically.

h4(#on_front_page_f). On front page? (f)

This is an extremely important option and should be considered with respect to the overall design of the site. Remember that section content only shows up when that section is called, except for the front page. This is the control that permits or denies content from showing up when index.php is called with no arguments.

h4(#syndicate_g). Syndicate? (g)

Textpattern creates RSS and Atom feeds for those who like to run news aggregators. If this selection is turned on, the feed will display article content from this section.

h4(#include_in_site_search_h). Include in site search? (h)

Textpattern provides a search function. It may be desirable to segregate some content and not make it available via the search function. This controls permits or denies the search from finding this content.

h4(#x_button_i). X button (i)

Click the “X” button if you ever want to delete a given Section.

Note: This “X” button can be found throughout the Site Administration interface, and it serves the same function wherever it is. If you don't see the button where it otherwise appears to be for similar options, it's likely because that particular option is a system default, and Textpattern does not allow you to delete system defaults. Sensibly so.

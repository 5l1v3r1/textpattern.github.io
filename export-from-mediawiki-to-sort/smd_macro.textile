\nLike tag names, we'll have a big obvious identifier here: *smd&#95;macro v n.n*

Then this summary paragraph, describing what type of plugin it is (front vs. admin), what function/area it relates with (e.g., navigation, images, Write panel, etc.), and what the plugin can essentially do. Very similar to how you would lead off a new plugin thread in the forum.

h3(sectionedit1#quick_use). Quick use

The focus of the entire sheet is on the current version of the plugin. This first section should give concise info about how to use it (not necessarily a full repeat of the docs that come with the plugin). This will likely be the bulk of the sheet.

We'll assume the plugin is installed already, so let's not repeat how to do that every time (we can link out to that in docs, or say it once on the landing page).

h3(sectionedit2#fixes_and_hacks). Fixes and hacks

If there are any, this is where they are briefly described, so people can find/use them easily.

h3(sectionedit3#tips). Tips

If there are good tips written up in the long forum threads, they could be pulled here so they're easier to find.

If there are related tips written up in "Txp Tips":http://txptips.com, provide links to those tips as a bulleted list.

h3(sectionedit4#case_examples). Case examples

If there are any websites, demos, videos, _etc._ of the plugin in use somewhere that easily shows the implementation, link them here.

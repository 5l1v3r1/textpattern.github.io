h3(sectionedit1#what_we_have_in_403). What we have in 4.0.3

The default section/page and the front page are the same. This default page is mainly used to display Categories browsing (/category/catName) and Authors browsing (/author/authorName). It's also the front page of a site.

h3(sectionedit2#issue). Issue

The frontpage is similar to other articles page on a blog like website, but a lot of non-blog websites use a specific frontpage. Some without even a txp:article tag in it. We can now detect the category browsing using a txp:if&#95;category name=“” / else trigger, but it's a trick. And a trick not usable for author browsing. And a complex one to newcommers, who have to deal with nested conditionnal triggers on their first template/page coding.

h3(sectionedit3#request). Request

Make a distinction between the default section/page, and the frontpage. It's more elegant and more simple to newcomers than another trick like a new txp:if&#95;author name=“” or something similar.

This would mean creating a new hardcoded FrontPage section, with a chosen page (exactly like the default section right now).

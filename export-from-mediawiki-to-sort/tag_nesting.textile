Similar to (X)HTML, TXP allows you to nest tags within tags, as long as you close them in the correct order (i.e. tag closing cannot overlap).

Indenting is used here to show which tags belong to which bits of contained content. Notice the order in which the tags are openend and closed; it follows standard (X)HTML and XML principles:

bc(code). <txp:if_section name="archive">
   <txp:if_category>
      category list within the archive section
   <txp:else />
      not a category list
   </txp:if_category>
<txp:else />
   some other section
</txp:if_section>


From Textpattern 4.0.7 and above, there are no limits on nesting depth and you can nest the same tag within itself:

bc(code). <txp:if_section name="article">
   My Articles
<txp:else />
   <txp:if_section name="about">
      About this website
   <txp:else />
      Umm, something else.
   </txp:if_section>
</txp:if_section>

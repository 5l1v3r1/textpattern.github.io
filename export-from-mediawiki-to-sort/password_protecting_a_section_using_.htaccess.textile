Describes how to easily establish HTTP authentication to protect a Section of your Texpattern site. Assumes your Web site is run on an Apache Web server, and that you have that you already have an existing _.htpasswd_ file containing usernames and passwords.

Typical scenario:

Your website is at *domain.tld*, Textpattern is installed in the root directory, and you want to password protect the section called _protected_ (*domain.tld/protected*)

h3(sectionedit1#the_process). The Process

# Physically create a folder as suggested by the Txp section (in our example it would be _protected_).
# Within the _protected_ directory, create an _.htaccess_ file and add the following to it:

&lt;IfModule mod&#95;rewrite.c&gt;

<pre class="code">
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(.*) ../index.php
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /path/on/server/to/.htpasswd
AuthName &quot;Only for registered users&quot;
require valid-user
</pre>

h3(sectionedit2#notes). Notes

If you need to initially create your _.htpasswd_ and _.htaccess_ files, one way is to check and see if your hostâ€™s control panel offers an automated way of doing it. For example, TextDrive provides this ability.

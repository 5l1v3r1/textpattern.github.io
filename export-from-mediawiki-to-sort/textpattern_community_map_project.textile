h3(sectionedit1#what_is_this_project). What is this Project?

It's a map. Or an index. Or both. It could be “just” an index, a table of contents and/or it could “manifest” into a graphic representation of Textland/TextPlanet/TextUniverse/TextGalaxy/TextWorld. In any case, it's a top-level index/Table of Contents of *ALL THINGS TEXTPATTERN*. Ultimately it could include Textpattern related sites and projects, information about their leaders and contributors, bios, skills, project and/or site purposes, technologies employed, etc.

In a nutshell: *It's a directory or table of contents of TeXtPattern-related entities as they currently exist on the web.*

h4(#background). Background

Project concept birthed with a forum post by Anark, "here":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=101399#p101399. It quickly gained interest, assumed a leader (neutrino), and became a "recognized Textpattern community project":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=102370#p102370.

h3(sectionedit2#objectives_criteria). Objectives/Criteria

The Map index should be:

* comprehensive
* easily updatable (a database)
* easily (re) skinnable
* located at root of an official Textpattern site (*ideally*)
* usable
* accessible
* interoperable

h4(#other_considerations). Other Considerations

The index could represent a community consensus of *who's who* and *what's what* in the Textpattern Community. A certain aesthetic/professional rating critera could be applied to the final decisions on what is included. (ie we might need to stop short of including every Textpattern install on the net). It's possible that we could instigate a competetive critera to the top {insert # here} Designers/Most Popular/Most Stable/Creative/Prolific/Best Sites/Hot Plugins/etc.

Whether represented graphically or as plain text the main content categories are (most likely to be) as follows:

* Documentation
* Development
* Design (e.g., TextGarden)
* Community (e.g. TxPMag)

h3(sectionedit3#possible_configuration). Possible Configuration

The initial idea is to develop a kind of navigational plan in multiple levels, or tiers (much like the levels of a index, Web site, or any other hierarchical structure of information). At the moment, three tiers are concieved.

Provide comments/suggestions about the developing model below in project discussion, or in the associated Forum thread, "Project: TxP Map":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=14993

h4(#tier_one). Tier One

Different Efforts:

* sites
* projects
* groups

h4(#tier_two). Tier Two

A more detailed presentation:

* past achievements
* future aims
* present state of play
* the toys being played with
* tools being tooled with
* whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involved in what capacity
* whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in charge of the Effort

h4(#tier_three). Tier Three

Bio pages:

* who these people
* what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing
* which Efforts theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been contributing to
* how they can be contacted

h3(sectionedit4#timeline). Timeline

This timeline is flexible, not cast in stone. It's expected to adjust as the scope and measure of the project changes.

This *_Languages_* view of the _Preferences_ panel is simply where you update your chosen languages file from upgrade to upgrade. The one that you activated during your initial installation of Textpattern will appear with a yellow background. You can also come here anytime to install a new language file as well, such as for multi-lingual publishing efforts.

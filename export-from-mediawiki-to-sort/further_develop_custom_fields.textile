h5(#option_to_create_custom_field_groups). Option to create custom field groups

* To be assigned per section (as 'uses page' and 'uses style' are chosen currently).
* For each custom field, select the label and input type (text-field, select, checkbox etc.)
* Select the order they appear
* Able to include specific parts by calling it's name/label from a tag (e.g. txp:body = txp:custom&#95;field&#95;name)

Examples of this can be found in "Expression Engine":http://www.pmachine.com/ee/features/, "Radiant":http://www.radiantcms.com/, and "Dabble DB":http://www.dabbledb.com/.

Jakob has done some work on this (see "his post on the Flickr group":http://static.flickr.com/110/274603728_31be709007_o.png. Perhaps he can enlighten?

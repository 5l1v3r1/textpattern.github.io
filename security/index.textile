h1. Textpattern security

The developers of Textpattern take system security seriously. They regularly audit the source code for potential "holes" that bad people might try to exploit. Textpattern can proudly claim that for many years now there has been no confirmed reports of an exploited hole in core Textpattern code. 

There have been occasional reports, however, of hacked Textpattern sites, and the problem has always been traced to security holes in _other applications_ (or in the web server itself), which were exploited and used to take control of the Textpattern administrator's account.

This is important to understand, because while Textpattern itself is quite secure, you can still make it vulnerable by using other technology in relation that is not as secure. *There is nothing Textpattern developers can do to defend against security holes in other applications.*

h2. Do your part for good security

Textpattern developers do their part to keep core code as secure as they can. It's up to you to do the rest. There are several things you can and should do to ensure the security of your website:

* Keep your Textpattern installation current by updating to the "latest stable release version":https:/textpattern.com/download.
* Check your "diagnostics":administration/admin/diagnostics.textile for security warnings. [todo:add warning examples on diagnostics page]
* Regularly verify the Textpattern plugins you've installed and have turned _on_ are the latest versions. (*Tip:** Subscribe to all the plugin author support threads for the plugins you use so you're informed when new versions are released.)
* Remove plugins you have turned _off_ and don't rely on anymore. (You can always reinstall them )
* If you're using other PHP or CGI applications, like a photo gallery or form mail application, make sure they are maintained and up to date.
* Don't leave test code or unused PHP/CGI applications on your server.
* Pay attention to security announcements from your hosting company or server admin. Likewise, if you find your host is slow to update its provided software, contact the host admins and remind them to do it.
* If you maintain your own web server, keep it updated with security patches. (If you maintain your own server, you should know that already.)

Textpattern developers have no control over the quality or security of community plugins, add-ons, and/or modifications to the core system. It's up to you to evaluate the security of third-party code.

h2. To modify or not modify the core for added security

Textpattern developers (current and past) tell us (e.g., "here":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=192807#p192807, "here":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=192818#p192818, and "here":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=192827#p192827) that a default installation of Textpattern is secure enough, and that trying to mask the identity of your Textpattern install or change the location of the admin login (i.e., changing the name of the configuration directory) is unwarranted, especially if your login details were wisely chosen and you follow all of the security precautions listed above. Thus, you are not advised to modify core files for the sake of security, but you are advised to keep on top of the other precautions listed above.

h2. Should you suspect your security is questionable

If you ever suspect a security problem in Textpattern installation, *do not publish any sensitive information about it*. "Report the security incident to core developers":http://textpattern.com/security immediately and give them a chance to respond to the issue.

# Textpattern user documentation repository

This repository drives the [Textpattern user documentation](https://docs.textpattern.com) website.

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! 

Proceed by reviewing — or doing, depending on the item — the following, presented here in the recommended order:

1. Review the [documentation guidelines](https://docs.textpattern.com/brand/textpattern-documentation-guidelines). These provide most of everything you need to know: the collaboration process, what to document, how to do it, and so forth.
2. Review the [editorial style guide](https://docs.textpattern.com/brand/textpattern-editorial-style-guide). This is Textpattern’s baseline editorial guidelines across all project sites and written material, not just documentation.
3. Review and/or use the [new documentation template](https://docs.textpattern.com/brand/textpattern-documentation-template). When you’re clear on what to do, this template quick-starts drafting your new documentation page.
4. Depending on how you might want to contribute, either clone this repository, or make changes directly via GitHub’s web interface, described below. Either way, a pull request will be initiated and reviewed by repository editors.
 
## Initiate a pull request via GitHub’s web interface

If you have a GitHub account and would like to contribute some authoring or editing, but would rather not fork or clone around, you can do the following:

1. Log into GitHub and return to this respository.
2. Go to the page you would like to revise in the [document tree](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.github.io). Pages are within sub-directories. Likely locations are [*/administration*](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.github.io/tree/master/administration), [*/development*](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.github.io/tree/master/development), [*/faqs*](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.github.io/tree/master/faqs), [*/tags*](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.github.io/tree/master/tags), or [*/themes*](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.github.io/tree/master/themes). (The [*/brand*](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.github.io/tree/master/brand) directory is for editors only.)
3. Click the pencil icon at top-right of the document (the hover text will read, ‘Edit this file’). You’ll then be in document edit mode.
4. Make your revisions using Markdown, except where HTML is required (e.g. [working with tables](https://docs.textpattern.com/brand/textpattern-documentation-guidelines#tables-html-only)).
5. Hit the **Commit changes** button when finished.

Step five will initiate a pull request. A member of the documentation team will then review your change request and act accordingly.

**One more thing…**

Decisions around the maintenance of documentation rely heavily on use of [Issues](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.github.io/issues), as described in the [documentation guidelines](https://docs.textpattern.com/brand/textpattern-documentation-guidelines).

Issues help bring documentation problems and changes to the attention of editors, who may want to ensure changes are made in the best way. It is often prudent, therefore, to [open a new issue](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.github.io/issues) about what you see needing done and let the hive mind determine the next step.

If it’s a small issue, chances are good an editor will take care of the problem. Thank you for the heads up.

If it’s a lot of little orthography problems across many pages, by all means clone and commit that pull request!

If it’s a more complex issue, like a bulk edit needed throughout the document tree, or a restructuring of the architecture, then it needs an editor’s attention regardless, even if to give counsil back about how to proceed. Start an [Issue](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.github.io/issues).

Other opportunities exist that don’t require a lot of editor interference for writing and editing documentation pages, such as producing new _shortcode_ pages, or adding better (less hypothetical) examples in existing tag pages, please! See the scope of possibilities for new material in the [Determining new topics](https://docs.textpattern.com/brand/textpattern-documentation-guidelines#determining-new-topics) section of the documentation guidelines.

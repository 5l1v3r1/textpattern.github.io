h1. When will the next version be released?

We don't discuss release dates or speculate about upcoming features in advance, because such predictions are invariably incorrect.

Textpattern is an open source project.  It is not developed in the same way as a monolithic, proprietary application.  We don't have a battery of programmers paid to obey orders.  Textpattern's developers - the core team, and occasional contributors - contribute code that they've written for their own projects and personal use.

This is not a bad thing: it means that the features added to Textpattern have been developed based on needs, not conjecture; and have usually already been tested on live sites.

What does this mean for your pet feature wishlist?  The priority of the development team will always be with the things that are closest to completion.  The more you can bring to the table, the more attention we'll give in return.

You don't have to be a software developer to help create a new feature: documentation, examples, test cases, and use cases will all help.

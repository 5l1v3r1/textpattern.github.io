h1. Does Textpattern support Trackback? [todo]

No.

We investigated the possibility of supporting Trackback, and concluded that it simply can't be done securely.  Trackback is "98% pure spam":http://photomatt.net/2006/02/28/spamback/, and there's no way to secure it.

It would be relatively easy for someone to develop a Trackback plugin.  There appears to be very little demand, however.

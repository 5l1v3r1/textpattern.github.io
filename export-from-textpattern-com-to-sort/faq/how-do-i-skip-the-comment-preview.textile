h1. How do I skip the comment preview? [todo]

You don't.  The preview step is an important part of Textpattern's anti-spam mechanism.  And trust me, you need that.  The only reports we've received of automated comment spam against Textpattern is on sites where the preview mechanism has been disabled.

There are some instructions floating around that describe ways of disabling it.  Usually these are for older versions of Textpattern, and often the result is that comments stop working, or something else fails.

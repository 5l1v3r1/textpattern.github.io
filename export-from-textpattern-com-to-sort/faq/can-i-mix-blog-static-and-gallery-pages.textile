h1. Can I mix blog, static, and gallery pages? [todo]

Yes.  The usual way to do this is to use a separate "section":http://textpattern.com/faq/78/ive-installed-textpattern-now-what for each type of content - for example, a @news@ section for your weblog-style content, a @gallery@ or @photoblog@ section for images, and a few sections named @about@, @contact@ and so on for "static" content.

Each Textpattern section can have its own page template.  Create one page template for each type of layout (weblog, image gallery, static), and assign the template to each section as appropriate.  Then simply post articles and/or images in the appropriate sections.

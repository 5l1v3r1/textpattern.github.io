h1. Why aren't the right articles showing up on my page? [todo]

These and similar problems are most commonly caused by replacing the @<txp:article />@ tag with @<txp:article_custom />@.

Always use @<txp:article />@ as the main article tag on your page. @<txp:article_custom />@ is for specialized use such as sidebars; think of it as an advanced version of @<txp:recent_articles />@.

For more information about the difference between the two tags, see "FAQ: What does article_custom do?":http://textpattern.com/faq/85/what-does-article_custom-do.

h1. Can Textpattern share a database? [todo]

Yes.  Set the Database Prefix to something unique when installing Textpattern.

For example, if you're installing multiple Textpattern sites that share the one database, you might use @txp1@ as the Database Prefix for the first site, @txp2@ for the second, and so on.

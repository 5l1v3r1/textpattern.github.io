h1. Errors during setup with MySQL 4.1.1 [todo]

This error is caused by a "bug in MySQL 4.1.1":http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=2130.

MySQL 4.1.1 was an early test release, not a production version of MySQL.  The first 4.1.x version deemed suitable for production use is "4.1.7":http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/news.html.

Please upgrade your server, or raise a support ticket with your hosting provider and ask them to upgrade MySQL to a release version.

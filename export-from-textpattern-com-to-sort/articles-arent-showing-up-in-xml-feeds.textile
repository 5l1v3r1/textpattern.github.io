h1. Articles aren't showing up in XML feeds [todo]

In order for articles to show up in an XML feed, they must:

* be in a section that has "Syndicate?" set to _Yes_
* have a status of *Live* (not Sticky)

Check the _Syndicate_ setting for the relevant sections  (see *txp > presentation > sections*), and the Status of the articles you're expecting to see.

If that doesn't help, try downloading a copy of the XML feed and viewing it manually.  It's possible that your news aggregator is choosing not to display some items, perhaps because it thinks they have already been read.

h1. Installing Textpattern

These are detailed instructions for installing and configuring Textpattern. If you're familiar with installing CMS software and prefer the quick notes, see the "__README.txt__":https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern/blob/master/README.txt file that's included in the install package.

h2(#sec1). Create your database

Before you can install Textpattern, you will need a MySQL database created, as well a user account for the database having 'write' privileges. This isn't really part of installing Textpattern, it's more a hurdle you jump with your web host, but now is a good time to take care of it so it's not holding up the setup process later. The information you will need ready when the time comes is:

* database name
* database user name
* database user password

That information will be used later to link Textpattern with the database and establish the configuration file, but we'll come back to that. For now create your database and keep the above data handy.

Note, depending on your web host, you may be forced to use your web host ID as a prefix on the database name and database user name. This will be evident at time of creating the database because the prefix will be added automatically, if at all. For example, if your web host ID was your last name (e.g., 'lname') and you named your database 'oceans', then your actual database name to use later would be "lname_oceans".

h2(#sec2). Download and unpack Textpattern

Now we begin the Textpattern part of the deal:

# Create a folder on your local drive (e.g., _txp-new_). 
# "Download":http://textpattern.com/download the latest release package (either __.zip__ or __.tar.gz __, as you prefer). 
# Move the zip package to the folder you created.
# Unzip the package.

The zip package will have a folder/file tree matching that in the "Textpattern repo":https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.[1]. Following are important folders and files you'll see.

|_. Name |_. Type |_. What it's for or contains |
| htaccess | file | Important for many reasons that are out of scope here, but not the least of which is handling URL formatting. |
| css.php | file | Handles the site's styles. |
| files | directory | Empty by default, but utilized if you upload content files later in the **Files** panel. |
| HISTORY.txt | file | The package release Changelog. |
| images | directory | Empty by default, but utilized later when uploading images in the **Images** panel.
| index.php | file | The default location of your site where web users will arrive, and dynamic publishing takes place. |
| js | directory | Contains JavaScript specific to the default website theme. This may be safely removed depending on whether you plan to use your own theme instead of the default. |
| README.txt | file | Provides brief instruction on installing and upgrading. |
| rpc | directory | Contains XML-RPC functionality. |
| sites | directory | Contains site template, and provides support for multi-site installations. |
| textpattern | directory | Contains all the core scripting and functionality. |

fn1. Do not move files in the tree or change their names. Doing so will render Textpattern useless.

h2(#sec3). Upload package to web server

If you intend to use Textpattern to manage the entire website, you'll upload the install package to your web root (i.e., the root of your web domain). For many hosts, the path to the root looks like this: __/users/home/{username}/web/public/__, where {username} is your user account name. You would upload the Textpattern package to the __/public__ directory (equal to _yourdomain.tld_). 

You may, of course, install it in a sub-directory if you're only using Textpattern to run a blog, for example, as part of a larger site. (Generally people who do that end up "moving the installation":moving-textpattern later.)

You will use FTP -- or Secure-FTP (SFTP), if your web host requires it -- to upload the package to your desired web server location. Two capable clients are WinSCP for Windows and Transmit for Mac.

When ready, make a FTP/SFTP connection to your web server and navigate to the directory where you intend to install Textpattern. If not done automatically by the FTP client, make a second connection to your local drive and navigate to where you have the unzipped Textpattern install package waiting. Select the package files (except, perhaps, README.txt and HISTORY.txt) and upload these to your server.

h2(#sec4). Setup and configure database connection

Now you'll walk through the setup process, which is a series of screens. Have you're database information ready. 

Assuming you uploaded the package to your web root, open a browser and go to __http://domain.tld/textpattern/setup/__. 

h3(#sec4-1). Screen 1: Welcome, select language

You should now see the "Welcome to Textpattern" setup screen, as well a dropdown list for choosing a language.[2] The language you select will be used for the setup process, and become the default for your Textpattern UI.[3]

When ready, click the **Next** button.

fn2. If you don't see this screen, check your URL path. Should it be "https" or "www."? Did you install in a sub-directory? Is there a typo?

fn3. You can change the UI language any time after setup in the **Preferences (Basic)** panel.

h3(#sec4-2). Screen 2: Database connection

The next screen asks for your MySQL database information. This is where you add the information you noted after creating your database originally. The fields you should see are for:

* database user name
* database user password
* database server (use "localhost")
* database name
* database table prefix (optional)
* Site URL

**Database user name** and **database name**. As mentioned at the beginning, you may need to prefix the database user name and database name with your web host user account ID. You should have seen if this was necessary, however, when creating the database.

**Database server**. The host server is almost always "localhost". It would be unusual if it wasn't, so try that first if your not sure. Textpattern sets "localhost" by default, so if you leave this field blank, you should still be fine.

**Database table prefix**. The screen will say you don't need to provide a table prefix if this will be your only installation of Textpattern. This assumes that you only have one MySQL database available to you. If that were true, adding a prefix here might be sensible so you could add another Textpattern installation to your database in the future without conflict, if you ever wanted to. But it's common anymore for web hosts to provide many databases, in which case you might use a unique database for each install, and thus no prefix would be needed. Either way, this field is optional. If you do use a prefix, a sensible convention is to end it with an underscore (e.g., 'txp1_').

**Site URL**. The site URL field should already be filled in on your screen. You only need to verify it's correct. The path should reflect where the installation is being made, so if you're installing Textpattern in a sub-directory, then that needs to be in the path. If the path isn't already added, type it in manually.

When ready, click the **Next** button.

If there was a problem with your database information, you'll be notified about it at this point and won't proceed to the next screen. You won't be told what the exact problem is either, so you'll have to figure that part out. It's usually because some aspect of the data you entered was wrong. Go over it again to check for mistakes. Check with your web host if you think there's an actual problem with the database account.

h3(#sec4-3). Screen 3: Config file setup screen

If all went well in the previous screen, then it's time to create your Textpattern configuration file in the __/textpattern__ directory. Textpattern makes this easy by taking the information you added in the previous screen and generating the required file contents to use. A partial of code is displayed to copy/paste into a __config.php__ file that you create. The code will look something like this, but with your own data values instead:

bc. <?php
$txpcfg['db'] = 'dbname';
$txpcfg['user'] = 'dbusername';
$txpcfg['pass'] = 'dbpassword';
$txpcfg['host'] = 'localhost';
$txpcfg['table_prefix'] = '';
$txpcfg['txpath'] = '/home/path/to/textpattern';
$txpcfg['dbcharset'] = 'utf8';
$txpcfg['client_flags'] = 0;
?>

Proceed as follows:

# Use your S/FTP client to connect to your installation directory and open __/textpattern/config-dist.php__ in your text editor of choice.
# Copy the code that Textpattern generated for you in the current install screen.
# Paste the code into the __config-dist.php__ file, completely overwriting its entire contents. 
# Save the file, close it, then rename it by removing the "-dist" from the file name (so it's only __config.php__).

Return to the install screen in your browser and click the **I did it** button.

h3(#sec4-4). Screen 4: Create the administrator account

You're almost home. You just need to create you're Textpattern administrator account, which will also generate the necessary Textpattern tables in your designated database.

Add a unique user name and password for the site administrator (this is *not* the same user name and password used for your database).

Click the **Next** button.

h3(#sec4-5). Screen 5: Confirmation and security screen

If all has gone well, Textpattern will indicate your tables have been generated and and provide a link to log into the administration side. 

It will also tell you to delete the __/textpattern/setup__ directory for security reasons. Do it now. Use your S/FTP client, go to the __/textpattern/setup__ directory, and remove it (and all its contents) from your server.

Return to the install screen in your browser and click the "Main interface" link at the top of the screen. This will take you to the administration login screen for your new Textpattern site.

h2(#sec5). Finishing the installation process

When you first login, you'll automatically land on the "**Preferences (Languages)**":../administration/prefs-languages-panel panel to update your language choice or choose another as the default. After that you're on your own, but your next stop should be the "**Preferences (Basic)**":../administration/prefs-basic-panel panel to set as many of those preferences as you can, particularly the ones pertaining to site identity, folder paths, time zones, and date/time formats.

Your next stop should be the "Diagnostics":../administration/diagnostics-panel panel to troubleshoot any installation/setup problems or minor annoyances. For example, if you didn't remove the /setup folder yet as described earlier, a diagnostic will appear to remind you again. Likewise you might see warnings about server directories needing different rights, and so forth.

When that's all done, you're ready to build your website. See "Administration fast-track":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/admin-fast-track for getting up to speed with the main building blocks.

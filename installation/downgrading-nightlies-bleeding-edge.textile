h1. Downgrading, nightlies, and bleeding edge

You have Textpattern CMS installed somewhere already and now you want to either downgrade, use a nightly build or use a development (bleeding edge) release.

h2. Downgrade to a previous stable release

'Downgrading' your installation to a previous release is *not advised for security reasons*. The only time you might want to do this is if you've upgraded to the newest stable release and found that one or more of your plugin functionalities are not working because they have not yet been updated by their developers to match the latest Textpattern code.

Downgrading is done exactly as upgrading. Follow the instructions for upgrading above but using the earlier Textpattern CMS version you need.

"List of archived Textpattern CMS releases":textpattern-release-history.textile.

h2. Apply the latest nightly build

'Nightly builds' or 'Nightlies' are discrete versions of Textpattern CMS code beyond the current stable release, but functional enough for testing purposes. *They are not intended for production sites!* People who upgrade to nightlies are generally developers and designers who will report bugs and give other feedback to core developers.

"Download the latest nightly":http://textpattern.com/download#nightly from Textpattern's download page.

Upgrading to a nightly build is done just like a regular upgrade. See the "Detailed upgrade instructions":detailed-upgrading-instructions.textile for more information.

h2. Explore the bleeding edge development

p(alert-block warning). For advanced users only!

The latest, *potentially unstable*, bleeding-edge code is available at "the GitHub repository":https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.

If you're thinking about testing this code, then we shouldn't have to tell you what "git":http://git-scm.com is or how to use it. If you don't know, then you don't really want to be messing about here!

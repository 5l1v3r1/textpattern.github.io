h1. Simple installation instructions

The user-friendly version:

# "Download":http://textpattern.com/download the latest @.zip@ or @.gzip@ package (currently version {{Txp current version}}).
# Create a new folder (e.g., @txp-unzipped@) on your local drive, move the zip file into it, and unpack "the file tree contents":https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern.
# Create an FTP connection to your server (sometimes SFTP is necessary, depending on your host requirements), and move the unpacked file tree to your web domain root (or subdirectory, if you plan to run it that way).
# Create a MySQL database and the associated user and password for it.
# Open a web browser and go to @example.com/textpattern/setup/index.php@ (or @example.com/sub-directory/textpattern/setup/index.php@ if you're running it from a sub directory), where @example.com@ is your web domain (and @sub-directory@ is your actual sub-directory of choice).
# Follow the instructions in the web browser.

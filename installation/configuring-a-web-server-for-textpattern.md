# Configuring a web server for Textpattern

Textpattern CMS is supported on any web server that supports PHP, MySQL and either Apache or NGINX. While other web server platforms are suitable for housing a Textpattern instance, additional considerations should be made for the web hosting server environment. This article offers guidance and tips for administrators wishing to install Textpattern to both supported web server platforms and other, unsupported web servers.

The article's scope extends to the functional requirements of configuring Textpattern on a existing production or web server. It does not focus on installation of the web server software itself, its security or subsequent performance optimisations.

## Supported environments

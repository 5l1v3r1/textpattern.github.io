# Configuring a web server for Textpattern

Textpattern CMS is supported on any web server that supports PHP, MySQL and either Apache or NGINX. While other web server platforms are suitable for housing a Textpattern instance, additional considerations should be made for the web hosting server environment. This article offers guidance and tips for administrators wishing to install Textpattern to both supported web server platforms and other, unsupported web servers.

The article's scope extends to the functional requirements of running Textpattern and does not focus on security or performance optimisations.

## Supported environments

* Apache, MySQL and PHP

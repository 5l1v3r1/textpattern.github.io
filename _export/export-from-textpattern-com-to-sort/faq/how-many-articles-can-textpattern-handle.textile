h1. How many articles can Textpattern handle? [todo]

There is no limit on the number of articles Textpattern can cope with.  Many sites use Textpattern to manage thousands of articles without any problems.

Performance is not dependent on the number of articles.  Textpattern is very fast, and there is normally no noticable difference in speed between a site with a dozen articles, and one (on the same server) with thousands of articles.

Textpattern does not have a "rebuild" process, so posting or editing an article is just as fast for your 10,000th article as for the first one.

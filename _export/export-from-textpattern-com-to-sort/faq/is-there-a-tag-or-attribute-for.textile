h1. Is there a tag or attribute for.. [todo]

The documentation at "Textpattern Documentation":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php is detailed and helpful.  Even experienced users will probably learn something they didn't already know.

The "Textpattern Tag Reference":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Tag_Reference describes almost every tag, organised by function. (It also includes an "alphabetical tag list":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Tag_Reference#mw-pages.)

Brand new tags and attributes might not be listed.  Textpattern Documentation is a community effort, so if you find something missing, consider "submitting some documentation yourself":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Help:New_Accounts

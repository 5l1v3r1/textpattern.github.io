h1. How do I log in? [todo]

If you've installed Textpattern at the root of your web site, go to @http://example.com/textpattern/index.php@

If Textpattern is installed in a subdirectory, try @http://example.com/mysubdir/textpattern/index.php@

On most servers you can leave off the @index.php@ part.

h1. How do I change the grey line separating articles? [todo]

The layout of each article is controlled by a *form*. Go to *textpattern > presentation > forms* and edit the one used by your page template (probably 'default', unless you've changed it).

Alternatively, you can create a new article form and use that to display articles. For more information, see "'How do I select which form is used to display articles?'":http://textpattern.com/faq/22/how-do-i-select-which-form-is-used-to-display-articles

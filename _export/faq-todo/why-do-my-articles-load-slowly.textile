h1. Why do my articles load slowly? [todo]

Go to:
Preferences > Advanced > Publish > Spam blacklists (comma-separated)

and remove @sbl.spamhaus.org@ if it is there.

If this does not resolve the problem, read up on "Diagnosing Performance Problems":/faq/136/diagnosing-performance-problems.

This FAQ does *not* apply to:

* Sluggish admin-side performance
* Slow rendering of *article list pages*
* Delays during a comment preview or comment post

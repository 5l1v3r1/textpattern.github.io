h1. Why can't I create a Forum account? [todo]

The most common cause of problems creating forum accounts are email spam filters and blacklists.

You must supply a working email address in order to create an account: when you sign-up, the forum software will send you the password you may use to login, to verify that your email address is correct and working properly.

Some email servers refuse to accept these emails, or incorrectly intercept them as spam. This is particularly common with free web mail services.

The following email providers seem to have problems accepting email from the forum, for one reason or another:

* bk.ru
* comcast.net
* hotmail.com
* inbox.ru
* list.ru
* mail.ru

It is therefore recommended that you use an address from another provider.

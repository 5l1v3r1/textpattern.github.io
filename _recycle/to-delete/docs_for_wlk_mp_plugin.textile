h3(sectionedit1#overview_of_plugin). Overview of Plugin

This plugin helps the designer of a textpattern-based site make useful image blocks from multiple images or categories. The idea and some of the code came from Harvery Kane's A List Apart article. Walker Hamilton ported the first version into a textpattern plugin.

This was seen as a plugin for a magazine style site.

Place the &lt;txp:wlk_mp /&gt; tag in an article, form or page. Attributes

width - specify entire width of magazine box.

padding - specify padding between images

alt - specify yer alt tag (I'm just putting this in there)

number - use only if specifying category, is the number of images you want returned. ( Defaults to 3 )

sort - use only if specifying category, can be 'ASC', 'DESC', or 'RAND()'. ( Defaults to 'RAND()' )

images - specify your images by id from the images list. should be a list of numbers, pipe-delimited (Ex. images = “1&#124;5&#124;8&#124;12&#124;16” )

or.....

category - specify a category from which to draw images (draws randomly is sort is not specified).

The selection tiers itself like so:

bc(code).    1. Checks to see if a category is specified in the tag itself, if not goes on to...
   2. Checks to see if a category was specified in a custom_field called 'magcategory', if not goes on to....
   3. Checks to see if tag had an attribute called images and had image ids or uris specified, if not goes on to....
   4. Checks to see if the custom_field, magimages had content and if those were image uris or numbers.
   5. Then, if the category was set checks to see if a number of images is set in a custom_field called 'magnum'...if that's not found....
   6. Then, checks to see if a number of images is set in a property called 'number' in the tag itself.....if that's not found....
   7. defaults to 3 images from that category.

h3(sectionedit5#examples_of_use). Examples of Use

&lt;txp:wlk_mp width=“600” padding=“3” alt=“magazine images” images=“1&#124;5&#124;6&#124;7” /&gt;

Putting the tag in a form means that every article tries to load this up. How do you specify images, then?

Easy enough. Go to â€œAdminâ€? → â€œAdvanced Preferencesâ€? and create a custom field called â€œmagimagesâ€?. Then whenever you want to specify images for your article, click the â€œAdvanced Optionsâ€? on the left hand side of your article creation page and enter the image numbers with the pipe character between them. (Ex. images = â€œ1&#124;5&#124;8&#124;12&#124;16â€? )

And donâ€™t worry about using up too many resources, if no images are specified, this plugin doesnâ€™t try and output anything! So you can have some articles with images and some without.

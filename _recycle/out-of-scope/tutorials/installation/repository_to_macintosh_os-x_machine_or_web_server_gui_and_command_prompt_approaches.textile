h3(sectionedit1#overview). Overview

(a little overview here; e.g., how the nice Mac provides SVN cababilities built-in, etc or whatever...if an overview isn't needed, delete this section altogether)

h4(#graphical_user_interface_svn_approach). Graphical User Interface (SVN Approach)

Get SvnX. Download it and use it.

h4(#graphical_user_interface_snapshot_approach). Graphical User Interface (Snapshot Approach)

# Get "Transmit":http://panic.com/transmit/ _3 or higher_ (also works with any other WebDAV compatible client app)
# Run Transmit
# Set the following:

*Server:* svn.textpattern.com *Initial Path:* /current *Protocol:* WebDAV

# leave other fields blank and hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“connectÃ¢â‚¬?
# The files you see are the most recent version of Textpattern

*_Important:_* _you should see an .htaccess file, if not make sure your preferences are set to show Ã¢â‚¬Å“hiddenÃ¢â‚¬? or Ã¢â‚¬Å“invisibleÃ¢â‚¬? files_

*Note:* This method will only download the most recent version of Textpattern. This is the “snapshot approach” meaning that the files downloaded will not be linked to the SVN repository. Future upgrades will have to be done manually.

h4(#command_line_approach). Command Line Approach

# Install _svn_ using "Darwin Ports":http://dawrinports.opendarwin.org or Fink.
# Run

bc. svn http://textpattern.com/svn/repos/current/path/to/your/TxP/directory/

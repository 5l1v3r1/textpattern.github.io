h1. Securing a section with password protection

A typical scenario: Your website is at *domain.tld*, Textpattern is installed in the web root, and you want to make a section private by requiring login access to it. This can be done by using HTTP authentication. The process assumes your website is on an Apache server, and that you already have an existing .htpasswd file containing usernames and passwords.

h2. The Process

# Physically create a directory where Textpattern is installed having the name given to the Textpattern section.
# Within that directory, create an .htaccess file and add the following to it:

&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;

<pre class="code">
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(.*) ../index.php
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /path/on/server/to/.htpasswd
AuthName &quot;Only for registered users&quot;
require valid-user
</pre>

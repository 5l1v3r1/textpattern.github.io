*Concept: A directory or table of contents of TeXtPattern-related entities as they currently exist on the web.*

It's a map. Or an index. Or both. It could be “just” an index, a table of contents and/or it could “manifest” into a graphic representation of Textland/TextPlanet/TextUniverse/TextGalaxy/TextWorld. I any case it's a top-level index/Table of Contents of *ALL THINGS TEXTPATTERN*.

It could be “a kind of pretty index, I guess, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“booksÃ¢â‚¬? and Ã¢â‚¬Å“indexesÃ¢â‚¬? go hand in hand.” (Destry)

Ultimately it could include Textpattern related sites and projects, information about their leaders and contributors, bios, skills, project and/or site purposes, technologies employed, etc.

h4(#criteria). Criteria

The Index/Map should be:

* comprehensive
* easily updatable (a database)
* easily (re) skinnable
* located at root of an official Textpattern site
* usable
* accessible
* interoperatable

h4(#considerations). Considerations

The index could represent a community consensus of *who's who* and *what's what* in the Textpattern Community. A certain aesthetic/professional rating critera could be applied to the final decisions on what is included. (ie we might need to stop short of including every Textpattern install on the net). It's possible that we could instigate a competetive critera to the top {insert # here} Designers/Most Popular/Most Stable/Creative/Prolific/Best Sites/Hot Plugins/etc.

Whether represented graphically or as plain text the main content categories are (most likely to be) as follows:

* Documentation
* Development
* Design (e.g. TextGarden)
* Community (e.g. TxPMag)

h1. Parse error: unexpected ..

These and similar errors occur when Textpattern's PHP files have been corrupted or incorrectly modified.  The best solution is to "download a fresh copy":/download/ and replace the files on your server.

If you're experiencing repeated problems, make sure your FTP client (or whatever program you're using to transfer files to your server) isn't set to ASCII mode.

h1. Where can I see Textpattern in action? [todo]

There's an "online demonstration of Textpattern":http://textpattern.co/demo.

You'll find "Textpattern templates available for download":http://themes.textpattern.com/ and "Textplates.com":http://textplates.com/.  The preview galleries provide good examples of the range of page layouts and styles made possible by Textpattern's template system.

"Txp Magazine":http://txpmag.com/ maintains a showcase of selected "Textpattern powered web sites":http://txpmag.com/by_cat.

h1. Plugin user-help guidelines

Use this template and associated guidelines when writing your plugin's user instructions.[1] Doing so will make it easier for you, as well result in plugin help that's complete, consistent across plugins, and more usable (intuitive and easy to navigate).

*Do not use inline CSS styling* of your own. Allow the presentation provided in the admin-side theme to work on its own. All you need to do is use the indicated Textile as clarified.

fn1. These guidelines and template derived from "this forum discussion":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=25327.

h2(#sec1). Suggested sections

This is the full set of sections for structuring your help file. You may not need all of these, but you should not need more than this. (Items in **bold** are what you must use no matter what.)

# **Summary and version details**
# Table of contents (use if you have more than three sections, or your sections are long)
# **List of features** (if you don't have many features, make this part of your summary)
# **Plugin requirements** (even if no requirements, say that)
# Installation (when differs from standard installation procedure)
# Uninstallation (when differs from standard uninstallation procedure)
# Tags (along with attribute descriptions and examples)
# Exposed functions (for class plugins)
# Global variables
# Plugin events
# Examples
# **License**
# **Author contact**

Obviously, if your plugin provides a tag or more, you will include sections 7 and 11 in your help file (and perhaps 8–10), and thus a Table of Contents too.

h2(#sec2). The template

The template takes into account the entire suite of sections indicated above. You remove the sections you don't need, but don't get creative beyond that. All Textile formatting is provided already -- with the exception of some options made clear at bottom -- all you have to do is fill in your content in the right locations.

h2(#sec1). Use Textile formatting

Textile is intuitive and will help keep your copy markup clean and readable. (Help files do not support Markdown.)

* "h2." for main section
* "h3." for subsections

**Paragraph copy:**

Write paragraphs without any need for paragraph-level formatting.

# A number list example
# Item 2
# Item 3

* A bullet list example
* Item 2
* Item 3

An inline @code@ tag

  code examples

h1. Plugin template

Textpattern plugins are perhaps best thought of as functions supplementary to those found in __textpattern/publish/taghandlers.php__. Functions residing in this file respond to @<txp:foo />@ and @<txp:foo>bar</txp:foo>@ tags found in __pages__, __forms__, __articles__ and other dynamic content containers in Textpattern. A "Textpattern plugin template":https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern-plugin-template is available on Github for plugin distribution.

h2(#sec1). Template package contents

In addition to the LICENSE and README files, the "plugin template":https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern-plugin-template contains the following:

* __zem_tpl.php__ -- Contains the code to compile plugins into the format required by the Textpattern plugin installer.
* __zem_plugin.php__ -- Is the template itself. Make a copy of this file and edit it to write your plugin.
* __zem_example.php__ -- Is an example plugin that demonstrates both public-side tags and admin-side user interface features.

h2(#sec2). Typical template use 

Here are some typical commands (via command-line) that you'll probably use:

bc. $ cp zem_plugin.php abc_myplugin.php
[edit abc_myplugin.php]
$ php abc_myplugin.php > abc_myplugin-0.1.txt

@abc_myplugin-0.1.txt@ is the finished plugin, ready to install.

h2(#sec3). Helpful notes

A few important and helpful notes.

# Whatever is returned by the plugin function will be output by the corresponding @<txp:plugin_name />@ tag.
# Plugin functions have access to all the functions available to __publish.php__, including everything in __textpattern/lib__. (Further reference on these resources is forthcoming.)
# If you would like to pass variables to the plugin function(s) via paramaters in the @<txp:plugin_name />@ tag, these will be passed as the first argument to the function as an associative array (@$varname => $value@).
# If you would like to pass a variable to the plugin function by enclosing it in @<txp:foo>bar</txp:foo>@, this will be passed as the second argument to the function as a string.
# Do not use @<?php ?>@ tags within the plugin source.

h2(#sect4). Speedy development

It speeds up development tremendously if you do the following:

# Make sure plugin name and plugin filename correspond; e.g., **zem_test** should be in __zem_test.php__.
# Create a directory, __/full/path/dev/plugins__.
# Drop your uncompiled plugins in that directory. Do not put __zem_tpl.php__ in the same directory.
# In the **Advanced preferences** panel of the admin-side, set plugin cache directory to __/full/path/dev/plugins__.

Now during development you can skip the compile, upload, activate steps (and you're not confined to editing in the admin panel or copy/paste). Simply edit the file in the tmp dir, it will be included on each run.

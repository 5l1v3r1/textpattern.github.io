h1. Plugin development

This information, and all pages linked from it, is not CMS end-user documentation. This is for those who are thinking about developing Textpattern plugins. Plugins allow functional extension of Textpattern without conflicting with core development, or without interfering with an end-user's ability to update her installation.

h2(#sec1). The deal

If you decide to develop a plugin, understand this...

Core developers put a lot of effort into maintaining backwards compatibility within the development branch of Textpattern itself, but that does not guarantee your plugins will continue to work as intended after new versions of Textpattern are released. Sometimes new development directions -- like what might come as we head to version 4.6 and later -- require making changes that affect backwards compatibility. As a plugin developer, it is your responsibility to ensure your plugins work against core code at point of every future Textpattern release. 

Cool? Great! Get started building plugins.

h2(#sec2). Reading up

Before diving into code, get some perspective.

h3. Plugins

Plugins to help build plugins, ironically enough.

* "ied_plugin_composer":http://textpattern.org/plugins/588/ied_plugin_composer -- This plugin allows you to create, code, and document plugins, then publish them in either conventional text format, compressed text format, or exported in the standard template format for sharing with developers or using in the plugin cache directory. This plugin also lets you directly edit plugins that are in the plugin cache directory.

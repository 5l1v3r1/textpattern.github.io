h2(#sec1). What is a plugin?

A "plugin" is a container for any kind of PHP code. The code can be a few lines of PHP, or _function_ and _class_ definitions.[1] Defining functions in the plugin is a common and easy way to start out, as they can be called from templates. But more advanced ways exist for plugins to influence Textpattern behaviour.

fn1. You can see the code for any installed plugin by clicking its name in the table on the **"Plugins":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/admin/plugins-panel**, or by installing and using "ied_plugin_composer":http://textpattern.org/plugins/588/ied_plugin_composer.

h3(#sec1-1). Functional categories

Plugins can be categorised in three functional ways:

* “on demand” -- providing tags for __pages__ and __forms__
* “up front” -- intercepting page requests (either all or those having special characteristics)
* “in between” -- using Textpattern hooks to automatically change or add behaviour.

The most practical (and most popular) plugins fall into more than one category, because a plugin is really nothing more than a container for code. If it provides functionality in multiple ways, it's likely providing more benefit to the user.

Plugins can also be public-side or admin-side.

h3(#sec1-2). Public-side plugins

Public-side (aka "client-side" or "front-side") plugins are those that enable content output on the front-side of a website, often through specialised tags, which a website designer can use interchangeably with Textpattern's core tags and HTML. These kinds of plugins don't have much in the way of requirements, thus are great plugins to try building when getting started with Textpattern plugin development.

* "Public-side plugin tutorial":http://docs.textpattern.io/development/public-side-plugin-tutorial -- A basic tutorial to learn the ropes of the easiest kind of plugin to build.

h3(#sec1-3). Admin-side plugins

Admin-side plugins provide site administrators and designers the ability to alter the "admin-side":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/ UI and/or functionality in some way. 

Admin-side plugins often make use of the **"Extensions":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/extensions/** region. In other words, if an admin-side plugin is designed to provide a user with special preferences, search mechanisms, functional controls, and so forth, they would be made available on their own sub-panel under the Extensions region.

h2(#sec2). Disclaimer

Before you embark on this journey, understand that core developers put a lot of effort into maintaining backwards compatibility within the development branch of Textpattern itself, but that does not guarantee your plugins will continue to work as intended after new versions of Textpattern are released. Sometimes new development directions -- like what might come as we head to version 4.6 and later -- require making changes that affect backwards compatibility. As a plugin developer, it is your responsibility to ensure your plugins work against core code at point of every future Textpattern release. 

Cool? Great! Let's build some plugins.

h2(#sec3). Developer rules of the road

More like three strong recommendations, meant to help ensure that you're producing plugins people will want to use. And that's the whole point, right?

**Avoid reinventing the wheel:** 

Before you start developing, spend some time researching what plugins exist, what functionality, they provide, and how well they're working for people (often indicated by how popular they are). While it might be good exercise to reinvent the wheel, building a plugin that does what another plugin already does isn't going to be immediately useful unless it's _extremely_ innovative in some way. If you decide to throw caution to the wind and reinvent the wheel anyway (perhaps stepping on toes in the process), make sure you're ready to raise the bar. Somebody has to eventually.

**Do it the Textpattern way:** 

Do it the “Textpattern's way” from the start by using "Textpattern functions":#sec7-2, whenever possible, which already work efficiently. Your goal should be to emulate Textpattern as you expand its capabilities, otherwise you run the risk of your plugin feeling foreign or out of place, and perhaps not working well with other plugins. Additionally, some functions are in place to assist with keeping Textpattern secure and working regardless of host server settings, and you don't want to interfere with that kind of thing.

**Write clear and concise plugin help:** 

Don't be one of those developers that assumes everyone knows what you know -- the opposite is true. People won't use your plugin, innovative or not, if you don't explain how. You can avoid fielding a lot of unnecessary questions in the support forum by producing good plugin user instructions to begin with. Use the "Plugin user help guidelines":http://docs.textpattern.io/development/plugin-user-help-guidelines to ensure your plugin instructions are consistently structured and properly formatted.

h2(#sec4). Register your plugin developer prefix

All hopeful plugin developers must have a "plugin developer prefix":http://docs.textpattern.io/development/registered-textpattern-developer-prefixes.

When developing your plugins, you will apply your prefix in the following places:

* In the names of PHP classes, functions, and global variables in the plugin's code.
* In the database table and indices names.
* In the names of stored preferences in the @_txp_prefs_@ table and/or the @$prefs array;@.
* In any global JavaScript variables or function names you use for modifying the backend or adding features to the front-end.
* In IDs and, to some extent, classes of HTML elements that you add to the backend interface.[2] 
* In URL parameter names. Replace @?foo=bar&baz=1@ with @?abc_foo=bar&abc_baz=1@, where "@abc@" would be your own prefix.

fn2. The exception to this is if an element of your markup is logically similar to an already existing core element and you wish it to be styled in the same way by themes. Doing this saves theme designers from having to write specific rules to target your plugin's markup.

h2(#sec6). Development guidelines

Before diving into code, get some perspective.

* "Plugin development guidelines":http://docs.textpattern.io/development/plugin-development-guidelines

* "Plugin basics":http://docs.textpattern.io/development/plugin-basics
* "How plugins are loaded":http://docs.textpattern.io/development/how-plugins-are-loaded

h2(#sec7). Callbacks

Textpattern makes extensive use of "callbacks":http://docs.textpattern.io/development/core-callback-list. Hook into these known points to choose where and when your plugins run.

h3(#sec7-1). __register_callback()__

@register_callback()@ is at the core of using callbacks. The full function definition looks like this:

bc. function register_callback($func, $event, $step='', $pre=0)

And the indicated names are:

* @$func@ -- The name of the function you coded and want to add to a callback-event.
* *$event -- The name of the (Textpattern-provided) event with which you want to associate your plugin.
* $step -- (Optional). *Admin-side only**: @$events@ are (disjunctively) divided into steps. For admin-side plugins, you have the choice of narrowing your plugin to a specific step.
* @$pre@ -- (Optional). *Admin-side only**: If this is set to @1@, @$func@ is called before any part of the page is rendered or executed. This allows you to "replace " existing panels on the admin-side. By default, however, @$func@ is called after the main part of the page is executed and rendered. Allowing your function to add things below it (or go for manipulating the DOM). 

h3(#sec7-2). Public-side callback events

There are four public-side callback events to be aware of.

These two are mainly for comments and spam-related plugins:

* comment.save -- Gets called after the nonce check passed, but before a plugin is saved.
* comment.form -- Gets called before a comment form is rendered and allows to add to it. 

These two are useful if you want to introduce your own uri-schemas:

* pretext -- Gets called at the beginning of @pretext()@.
* textpattern -- Gets called at the beginning of @textpattern()@. 

For example, say you decided to write an archive plugin and wanted to prevent the the url, __domain.tld/section/archive/__, from returning a 404.

h3(#sec7-3). Admin-side callback events

Callback events on the admin-side are easy to recognize in the address bar of your browser. If you click on any admin-side panel link, you'll see the url contains "_?event=panelname_", and if you click on any link in that panel, you'll see "_?event=panelname&step=anotherthing_". Those values correspond to the _events_ and _steps_ you can use for your plugins. In fact, they will call any user-defined function that is registered for said event/step, allowing you to add your own events and steps as you need them.

h3(#sec7-3). Admin-side layout modifications with __pluggable_ui()__ callback events

A special type of callback, @pluggable_ui()@, is used throughout the core to allow plugin developers to redesign or alter the layout of the admin side.[3] 

This callback's event usually ends in @_ui@ and begins with the event to which it refers. For example, on the **Write** panel the events are @article_ui@, and on the **Files** panel the events are @file_ui@.

The _step_ is usually the part of the page that contains the element you wish to change. On the **Write** panel, for example, the **Article image** control has a step called @article_image@ and the **Custom fields** area has one called @custom_fields@, and so on.

When writing your own functions using the @pluggable_ui()@ callbacks, note they have a different function signature from regular callbacks. They usually have 4 parameters:

# event
# step
# default content -- The markup that is used if you don't modify it.
# record set (if applicable) -- The records returned from the database that pertain to this event. (E.g. on the **Write** panel this would be one row containing the columns from the currently edited article.) 

Sometimes (e.g., when dealing with preference settings) the fourth argument becomes the preference name and a fifth argument holds its value.

Consult the "Core callback list":http://docs.textpattern.io/development/core-callback-list for detailed information on all the callbacks available within Textpattern.

fn3. *Attention!* Though it's possible to completely redesign the HTML markup within the page, it is advisable to refrain from this action. For example, by removing @<input id="article_image">@ from the **Write** panel, you may render Textpattern (and plugins that rely on the existence of such a DOM element) inoperable. If you must rename selectors (IDs, classes), consider leaving the existing items intact and adding your own, then setting the originals to @display:none@ via CSS. 

h2(#sec8). Functions and variables

Be aware of the *helper functions*. Helper functions can be found in the “lib” folder:

* @txplib_db.php@ -- for interacting with the Textpattern database
* @txplib_forms.php@ -- to help build various HTML form elements
* txplib_html.php -- to help build various other HTML elements
* @txplib_misc.php@ -- various “miscellaneous” functions.

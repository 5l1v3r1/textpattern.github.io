h1. Textpattern CMS documentation

Textpattern documentation without the wiki (a work in progress). See "index":index.textile.

h2. Filename (URL) conventions

To ensure SEO friendly URL patterns, and for consistency, all directory names/file names should be structured using the following rules:

# All text in lowercase.
# Use hyphens, *not* underscores, to separate words within the URL.
# Use Textile formatting (Markdown is not to be used) and ensure @.textile@ extension is appended to filenames.

*Example:*

bc. file-download-description.textile

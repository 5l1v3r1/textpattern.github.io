h1. Textpattern CMS user documentation

See the **"Main Index":index.textile.** 
This is the new user documentation, and it's a work in progress.

On this page are guidelines for doc authors:

* "Filename (URL) conventions":#sec1
* "Document page structure":#sec2
* "Concise copywriting tips":#sec3

h2(#sec1). Filename (URL) conventions

To ensure SEO friendly URL patterns, and for consistency, all directory names/file names should be structured using the following rules:

# All text in lowercase.
# Use hyphens, *not* underscores, to separate words within the URL.
# Use Textile formatting (not Markdown).
# Ensure filenames have @.textile@ extension.

*Example:*

bc. file-download-description.textile

h2(#sec2). Document page structure

Make doc pages *scannable* with a *consistent structure* across them, as much as possible. These guidelines can help:

# Start page with an "h1" header that serves as the document's title.
# Avoid using h4-h6 header levels, if possible. Deep structuring means the copy is probably too complex. Try and structure content with h2-h3 only.
# If you have more than two "h2" sections on the page, follow the h1 title with an in-page ToC ("see ToC example":security/index.textile). Do this by:
## adding "On this page:" in normal text, followed by 
## an unordered list of links to the "h2" headers only, and
## use "#sec1", "#sec2", "#sec3", etc as the anchors to make it easy.
# Use footnotes in a given h2 section for any "Tips" or side details not needing said in the primary paragraph. ("see footnote examples":security/index.textile)

h2(#sec3). Concise copywriting

To improve the ability to scan pages as described above, write as concisely as you can, and use the style guide [link needed]. Here are a few quick wins for cleaner copy:

# Write in the third-person. You're speaking to an individual on behalf of Textpattern, so you don't use "me", "I", "my", etc. (But you will use "you", "your", etc.) When you don't talk about something from your personal point of view, you say a lot less. It's magic.
# Avoid passive 'to be' and 'to have' verb structures (e.g., could be/have, should be/have, might be/have). Passive writing is not only miserable to read, it bloats copy with unnecessary words. Find a more direct/active way of wording the phrase. For example, instead of "The widget should be at the top of the sidebar." say "Put the widget at top of the sidebar."
# Avoid useless adverbs like "very", "really", "only" and many others. For example, "If you really want to do that." is better as "If you want to do that." A person either wants to or doesn't, adding "really" does't change anything.
# Question every use of "that" and "just" in your copy. It's easy to abuse both words. Every time you use "that" or "just" in a sentence, read the sentence and see if it still makes sense without the word. Most of the time it will. If it does, it's probably correct to leave the words out.
# Avoid over use of adverbs, idioms, and other partial clauses at the beginning of sentences: "Meanwhile, ...", "On the other hand, ...", "However, ...", "In other words, ...", "Nevertheless, ..." and so forth. This doesn't mean never use them, but if you're using them regularly, or more than once in a paragraph, then it's too much. Rewrite the sentences more concisely without the clause breaks.

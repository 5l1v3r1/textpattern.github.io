h1. Textpattern administration

The administration side of Textpattern (often called "admin-side") is where the site administrator -- and any "users":admin/users-panel having sufficient rights -- configures and manages the website's content, architecture, presentation, and behaviour (excluding what might need done via the web or database servers).

* "Admin-side organisation":#sec2

* "Changing default login panel":#sec4

h2(#sec1). Login location

Users typically install Textpattern in the root location of a website's domain because they intend to run the entire website with the CMS. This puts the login location at __/domain.tld/textpattern__.[1] If you install Textpattern in a sub-directory, the login location would reflect that, one level down (/__domain.tld/sub-directory/textpattern__).

fn1. See "Textpattern security":security if you're worried about the login location being common knowledge.

h2(#sec2). Admin-side organization

The administration side is organized into three primary regions: **Content**, **Presentation**, and **Admin**.[2] Each region has a set of working panels, listed below, one of which serves as the default landing location for that region. A tertiary set of panels exists in the case of the **Admin** section's **Preferences** panels:

* Content
** Articles
** Categories
** Comments
** Files
** Images
** Links
** Write (default)
* Presentation
** Forms
** Pages (default)
** Sections
** Styles
* Admin
** "Diagnostics":admin/diagnostics-panel
** Import
** "Plugins":admin/plugins-panel
** Preferences
*** Basic (default)
*** Advanced
*** Language
** "Users":admin/users-panel (default)
** "Visitor logs":admin/visitor-logs-panel
* "Extensions":extensions

fn2. The **Extensions** region is not a core system region. It only appears (to site administrators and publishers) if you install any of the admin-side plugins that make use of it.

h3. Language selection

English is the default installation language for the administration side of Textpattern.

**Changing the default language:**

You are given a chance to change the default language immediately following your first log in. The **Preferences (Update languages)** panel under the **Admin** region will automatically appear, where you can "Install" the additional language(s) you want to use. A green confirmation message will flash at bottom of screen after each language install. When done, click the yellow **Save** button.

After installing the additional language(s) you want, override the English default by selecting the new default language via the drop-down selection box at top of the languages table. Again, save the changes.

**Updating language packs:**

You won't be auto-directed to the **Update languages** panel with each update of your Textpattern installation, but go there anyway when you do update because language packs may have been modified since Textpattern's last version release and you want to implement them if so. You'll easily see the languages you initially installed because they will be labeled as "Update" instead of "Install". Update them all and click the **Save** button when done.

h3. Configuration of site identity and publishing behaviour

Your next stop after languages is **"Preferences (Basic)":admin/basic-prefs-panel.textile** to configure site identity values, choose time zones and date formats, set necessary file paths, establish desired publishing behaviour, and so forth.

Don't worry about getting everything perfect the fist pass. Some things won't be applicable anyway until you've planned your website architecture. Jut focus on the things that you know can be set, and save all changes.

h3. Diagnostics check

When basic preferences are set, go to the **"Diagnostics":admin/diagnostics-panel** panel to address the warning messages in the **Pre-flight checks** section.

h3. Build your architecture

When all diagnostics checks are clear, you're ready to build your site architecture and presentation. Building publishing architectures with Textpattern requires time learning and tinkering. There's no direct 1-2-3 method for it. But the learning is fun, and once you understand how Textpattern structures content and puts it together, you'll thank yourself for choosing such an elegant system.

For further orientation on publishing architecture basics, see "Administration fast track":/administration/admin-fast-track.

h2(#sec4). Changing default login panel

The default admin-side landing location changes once you initially set your language preferences. You'll find yourself landing on the **"Write":content/write-panel** panel from that point on, which is the default panel under the **Content** region.[3]

You can change the default landing panel in **"Basic preferences":admin/preferences-basic-panel** to whatever admin-side panel you want. In **Basic preferences**, look under the **Admin** area for the preference, "Default admin tab".[4] Use the drop-down menu to select the panel you want, then save.

fn3. The assumption is that once your site is built, you'll want to go straight to writing new articles every time. But not everybody does.

fn4. The preference label will eventually change to "Default administration panel". Backstory: The default theme of the administration side was originally conceived as a system of manilla file folders, with primary and secondary panel labels depicted as folder "tabs". The concept impacted the mental models of long-time users, who still frequently refer to panels as "tabs" even though they may use a different admin-side theme. "Tab" is even used in core legacy code from time to time, which you might find if you "build admin-side plugins":../development/. "Panel" is now the preferred taxonomic term and in Textpattern's "brand guidelines":../brand/.

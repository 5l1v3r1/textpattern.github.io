h1. Textpattern administration

The administration side of Textpattern is where you, and any "users":admin/users-panel having sufficient "privileges":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/user-roles-and-privileges, configures and manages the website's content, architecture, presentation, and behaviour (excluding what might need done via the web or database servers).

h2(#sec1). Login location

The typical admin login location for a new install of Textpattern is at __domain.tld/textpattern__.[1] If you install Textpattern in a subdirectory, the login location would reflect that as __domain.tld/subdirectory/textpattern__.

fn1. See "Textpattern security":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/security if you're worried about the login location being common knowledge.

h2(#sec2). Core administration regions and panels

The administration side is organized into three primary regions: **Content**, **Presentation**, and **Admin**. Each region has a set of working panels, one of which serves as the default for when the primary region link is clicked.

h3(#sec2-1). Content

The **Content** region of the administration side has seven panels out-of-the-box, of which the **Write** panel is the default.

notextile. <div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Table">

| |_. What the panel provides you |
| **Articles** | A table listing of all articles, and the ability to open one in full-edit mode in context of the **Write** panel. |
| **Categories** | Functionality to create and manage topic categories for articles, images, links, and files. |
| **Comments**[2] | A table of all article comments received and functionality to manage them. |
| **Files** | A table listing of all files uploaded and functionality to manage them. |
| **Images** | A table listing of all images uploaded and functionality to manage them. |
| **Links** | A table listing of all links uploaded and functionality to manage the. |
| **Write** (default) | Article editing fields and controls. |

notextile. </div>

fn2. In Textpattern 4.6, when the "Accept comments?" preference is set to "No" in the **Preferences** panel, all comments functionality throughout the administration side will be hidden in the UI and the **Comments** panel link will be removed from the list of panel options in the **Content** region. This helps keep unwanted functionality from being a distraction. The comments functionality all comes back again if the preference is changed to "Yes". 

h3(#sec2-2). Presentation

The **Presentation** region of the administration side has four panels out-of-the-box, of which the **Pages** panel is the default.

notextile. <div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Table">

| |_. What the panel provides you |
| **Forms**[3] | A list of forms by type (Textpattern forms, not web forms for submitting data) and functionality to create and manage them. The "default" **Article** form type displays by default. |
| **Pages** (default) | A list of HTML page templates and functionality to create and manage them. The "default" page displays by default. |
| **Sections** | A table listing of sections and functionality to create and manage them. |
| **Styles** | A list of CSS style files and functionality to create and manage them. The "default" style displays by default. |

notextile. </div>

fn3. "Forms" may one day be renamed to "Partials" to better suggest their nature, but core developers have made it clear the change is not on their list of priorities due to the amount of work it would take to edit the core. Patches are probably welcome from the community. 

h3(#sec2-3). Admin

The **Admin** region of the administration side has seven panels out-of-the-box, of which the **Users** panel is the default.

notextile. <div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Table">

| |_. What the panel provides you |
| "**Diagnostics**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/diagnostics-panel | Feedback messages and data displays to troubleshoot system problems. |
| "**Import**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/import-panel | Functionality to import data from another publishing system. |
| "**Languages**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/languages-panel (Update languages)[4] | A list of language packs and the ability to update them. |
| "**Plugins**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/plugins-panel | A table listing of installed plugins, and functionality to manage them. |
| "**Preferences**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/preferences-panel (basic/advanced)[4] | All configurable settings to make your site function correctly and as desired. |
| "**Users**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/users-panel (default) | A table listing of all user accounts and the functionality to manage them. |
| "**Visitor logs**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/visitor-logs-panel | A display of all site traffic. |

notextile. </div>

Examples of plugins that add additional panel options to the **Admin** region include smd_faux_role and wet_snitch.

fn4. The current version of Textpattern has a tertiary level of panels under the **Preferences** link: **Basic** (default), **Advanced**, and **Update languages**. Beginning with Textpattern 4.6, the **Basic** and **Advanced** panels will merge into a single, functional **Preferences** panel, and **Update languages** will become a new panel called **Languages** under the **Admin** region. The **Admin** panel list above shows the new 4.6 options.

h2(#sec3). Extended administration regions

There are also two extended regions (not out-of-the-box) -- **Home** and **Extensions** -- which appear to the higher "user roles":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/user-roles-and-privileges if any of the admin-side plugins that make use of them are installed. These regions are not core features, but are worth describing here because they become part of the administration's navigation when relevant.

h3(#sec3-1). Home (Start)

The "**Home**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/home-region region is associated with dashboard development for multi-user websites. If you're not building a multi-user website, you will not be concerned with this, and even then you may not need the plugins that make this region appear.   

h3(#sec3-2). Extensions

The "**Extensions**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/extensions-region region is likely one you will see in the administration side eventually because several useful plugins make use of it.

h2(#sec4). Changing default login panel

The default admin-side landing location changes once you initially set your language preferences. You'll find yourself landing on the "**Write**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/write-panel panel from that point on, which is the default panel under the **Content** region.

You can change the default landing panel to whatever admin-side panel you want. In "**Preferences**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/preferences-panel, look under the **Admin** area for "Default administration panel".[5] Use the drop-down menu to select the panel you want, then save.

fn5. The current preference label is, "Default admin tab". Beginning with version 4.6 the label will become "Default administration panel", which is a normalization against "Textpattern guidelines":http://docs.textpattern.io/brand/.

h1. Textpattern administration [todo:dw]

The administration side of Textpattern (often called "admin-side") is where the website administrator (perhaps you) -- as well as any additional "users":administration/users/index.textile having the right kind of access -- manages most aspects of the Textpattern installation (exluding what actually needs done on the web server itself).

h2. Login location

Users typically install Textpattern CMS in the root location of a website's domain because they intend to run the entire website with the CMS. This puts the login location at __domain.tld/textpattern__.[1] If you installed Textpattern in a sub-directory, the login location would reflect that (__domain.tld/sub-directory/textpattern__).  

fn1. See "Textpattern security":../security/index.textile if you're worried about the login location being common knowledge.

h2. First tasks after intallation or upgrade

When you first log in after an intallation (or upgrade), you'll be taken to the  "Language":admin/preferences-language-panel.textile preferences panel under the "Admin":admin/index.textile area to install (or update) the language packs you choose to use. Be sure you make the language selection(s) _and_ save the changes.

Your next stop should be the "Diagnostics":admin/diagnostics-panel.textile panel to check if there are any warnings are problems to troubleshoot. Then go configure your "Basic preferences":admin/preferences-basic-panel.textile, such as site identity values, time zones, publishing behaviour, and so forth. 

Eventually you'll tackle setting up site architecture and presentation with a little trial and error. Building publishing architectures with Textpattern is a big chunk of learning and tinkering, and there's no direct 1-2-3 method for it, but the learning is fun, and once you understand how it all fits together you'll thank yourself for choosing such an elegant system. See "administration highlights":administration-highlights.textile for getting up to speed with common admin navigation routes and tasks.

h2. Routine default panel

After your initial log in to set languages, as described above, the default admin-side landing location changes; you'll find yourself landing on the "Write panel":content/write-panel.textile after loggin in, which is under the "Content":content/index.textile area of the admin-side. The assumption is that once your site is built, you'll want to go straight to the Write panel every time.

You can change the default landing location in "Basic preferences":admin/preferences-basic-panel.textile to whatever admin-side panel you want. Look under the *Admin* section on the Basic preferences panel and find the preference for "Default admin tab". Use the drop-down menu to select the panel you want, then save.

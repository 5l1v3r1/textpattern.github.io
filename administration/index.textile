h1. Textpattern administration

The administration side of Textpattern (often called "admin-side") is where the website administrator -- and any additional "users":administration/users/index.textile having rights of access -- manages website content, architecture, presentation, and behaviour configuration (exluding what actually needs done on the web server itself).

h2(sec1). Login location

Users typically install Textpattern CMS in the root location of a website's domain because they intend to run the entire website with the CMS. This puts the login location at __domain.tld/textpattern__.[1] If you installed Textpattern in a sub-directory, the login location would reflect that (__domain.tld/sub-directory/textpattern__).  

fn1. See "Textpattern security":../security/index.textile if you're worried about the login location being common knowledge.

h2(sec2). Admin-side organisation

The admin-side is organised into three primary regions (Content, Presentation, Admin), with each region having a secondary set of working panels. A third set of panels exists in the case of Preferences only. One panel in each primary region (and the secondary Preferences region) serves as the default view:

* Content
** "Articles":content/articles-panel.textile
** "Categories":content/categories-panel.textile
** "Comments":content/comments-panel.textile
** "Files":content/files-panel.textile
** "Images":content/images-panel.textile
** "Links":content/links-panel.textile
** "Write":content/write-panel.textile (default)
* Presentation
** "Forms":presentation/forms-panel.textile
** "Pages":presentation/pages-panel.textile (default)
** "Sections":presentation/sections-panel.textile
** "Styles":presentation/styles-panel.textile
* Admin
** "Diagnostics":admin/diagnostics-panel.textile
** "Import":admin/import-panel.textile
** "Plugins":admin/plugins-panel.textile
** Preferences
*** "Basic":admin/preferences/basic-prefs-panel.textile (default)
*** "Advanced":admin/preferences/advanced-prefs-panel.textile
*** "Language":admin/preferences/language-prefs-panel.textile
** "Users":admin/users-panel.textile (default)
** "Visitor logs":admin/visitor-logs-panel.textile
* Extensions[2]

fn2. The Extensions panel is not a core system panel. It only appears if you install any of the admin-side plugins that make use of it, and you probably will eventually. Two examples: "smd_bio":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=31496 is a popular admin-side plugin for extending core user data, which is helpful for creating author bio pages in multi-contributor websites. And "ied_plugin_composer":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=14898 (now maintained by "smd"), is a powerful plugin for those interested in "plugin development":../plugins/index.textile.

h3. Language selection

English is the default installation language for the admin-side of Textpattern. You are given a chance to change this immediately following your first log in. You'll be taken to the "Update languages":admin/preferences-language-panel.textile panel under the **Admin** area to "Install" the additional language(s) you want to use.[3] You'll see a green confirmation message at bottom of screen after each language install. When done, click the yellow **Save** button.

If you install more than one language, you can override the English default by selecting the new default via the drop-down selection box at top of the languages table. Again, save the changes. 

You won't be auto-directed to the **Update languages** panel with each update of your Textpattern installation, but go there anyway when you do update because language packs may have been modified since Textpattern's last version release and you want to implement them if so. You'll easily see the languages you initially installed because they will be labeled as "Update" instead of "Install". Update them all and click the **Save** button when done.

h3. Configuration of site identity and publishing behavior

Your next stop after languages is "Basic preferences":admin/basic-prefs-panel.textile to configure site identity values, choose time zones and date formats, set necessary file paths, establish desired publishing behaviour, and so forth. Don't worry about getting everything perfect the fist pass. Some things won't be applicable anyway until you've planned your website architecture. Jut focus on the things that you know can be set, and save all changes.

h3. Diagnostics check

When basic preferences are set, go to the "Diagnostics":admin/diagnostics-panel.textile panel to address the warning messages under **Pre-flight checks**, until you get a green, "All checks passed!" feedback messasge.

h3. Build your architecture

Whenall diagnostics checks are clear, you're ready to build your site architecture and presentation with a little trial and error. Building publishing architectures with Textpattern is a big chunk of learning and tinkering, and there's no direct 1-2-3 method for it. But the learning is fun, and once you understand how things all fit together, you'll thank yourself for choosing such an elegant system. 

For further orientation on publishing architecture basics, see "administration highlights":administration-highlights.textile.

h2(sec4). Changing default login panel

The default admin-side landing location changes once you's initially set your language preferences. You'll find yourself landing on the "Write panel":content/write-panel.textile from that point on, which is the default panel under the "Content":content/index.textile region of the admin-side. The assumption is that once your site is built, you'll want to go straight to writing new articles every time.

You can change the default login landing location in "Basic preferences":admin/preferences-basic-panel.textile to whatever admin-side panel you want. In Basic preferences, look under the **Admin** section and find the preference for "Default admin tab".[4] Use the drop-down menu to select the panel you want, then save.

fn4. The presentational theme of the admin-side's organisation was originally conceived as a system of file folders, with each region label depicted as a folder "tab". This presentational concept has left an impact on the mental models of long-time users, who will frequently refer to panels as "tabs" even though they may use an admin theme that does not depict the file folder concept. You'll even see the word "tab" used in the admin-side UI, as in this case, but not only. For purposes of user documentation, "panel" and "tab" mean exactly the same thing, but docs will only use "tab" when a specific reference is being made to the admin-side UI where the word is still encoded.

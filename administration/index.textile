h1. Textpattern administration

The administration side of Textpattern (often called "admin-side") is where the site administrator -- and any "users":admin/users-panel having sufficient rights -- configures and manages the website's content, architecture, presentation, and behaviour (excluding what might need done via the web or database servers).

** "Content":#sec2-1
** "Presentation":#sec2-2
** "Admin":#sec2-3
** "Extensions":#sec2-4
* "Changing default login panel":#sec3

h2(#sec1). Login location

The typical admin login location for a new install of Textpattern is at __domain.tld/textpattern__.[1] If you install Textpattern in a subdirectory, the login location would reflect that as __domain.tld/subdirectory/textpattern__.

fn1. See "Textpattern security":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/security if you're worried about the login location being common knowledge.

h2(#sec2). Administration regions and panels

The administration side is organized into three primary regions: **Content**, **Presentation**, and **Admin**. Each region has a set of working panels, one of which serves as the default for when the primary region link is clicked.

There is a fourth region, **Extensions**, that does not exist out-of-the-box, but it's worth describing here along with the core regions because you are likely to see it eventually. 

h3(#sec2-1). Content

The **Content** region of the administration side has seven panels out-of-the-box, of which the **Write** panel is the default.

| |_. What the panel provides you |
| **Articles** | A table listing of all articles, and the ability to open one in full-edit mode in context of the **Write** panel. |
| **Categories** | Functionality to create and manage topic categories for articles, images, links, and files. |
| **Comments**[2] | A table of all article comments received, and functionality to manage edit them. |
| **Files** | A table listing of all files uploaded and functionality to manage them. |
| **Images** | A table listing of all images uploaded, and functionality to manage them. |
| **Links** | A table listing of all links uploaded and functionality to manage them. |
| **Write** (default) | Article editing fields and controls; is the primary content editor in Textpattern. |

notextile. </div>

fn2. In Textpattern 4.6, when the "Accept comments?" preference is set to "No" in the **Preferences** panel, all comments functionality throughout the administration side will be hidden in the UI and the **Comments** panel link will be removed from the list of panel options in the **Content** region. This helps keep unwanted functionality from being a distraction. The comments functionality all comes back again if the preference is changed to "Yes". 

h3(#sec2-2). Presentation

The **Presentation** region of the administration side has four panels out-of-the-box, of which the **Pages** panel is the default.

notextile. <div class="tabular-data" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Table">

| |_. What the panel provides you |
| **Forms**[3] | A list of forms by type (Textpattern forms, not web forms for submitting data) and functionality to create and manage them. The "default" **Article** form type displays by default. |
| **Pages** (default) | A list of HTML page templates and functionality to create and manage them. The "default" page displays by default. |
| **Sections** | A table listing of sections and functionality to create and manage them. |
| **Styles** | A list of CSS style files and functionality to create and manage them. The "default" style displays by default. |

notextile. </div>

fn3. "Forms" may one day be renamed to "Partials" to better suggest their nature, but core developers have made it clear the change is not on their list of priorities due to the amount of work it would take to edit the core. Patches are probably welcome from the community. 

h3(#sec2-3). Admin

The **Admin** region of the administration side has seven panels out-of-the-box, of which the **Users** panel is the default.

notextile. <div class="tabular-data" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Table">

| |_. What the panel provides you |
| "**Diagnostics**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/diagnostics-panel | Feedback messages and data displays to troubleshoot system problems. |
| **Import** | Functionality to import data from another publishing system. |
| **Languages** (Update languages)[4] | A list of language packs and the ability to update them. |
| "**Plugins**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/plugins-panel | A table listing of installed plugins, and functionality to manage them. |
| **Preferences** (basic/advanced)[4] | All configurable settings to make your site function correctly and as desired. |
| "**Users**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/users-panel (default) | A table listing of all user accounts and the functionality to manage them. |
| "**Visitor logs**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/visitor-logs-panel | A display of all site traffic. |

Examples of plugins that add additional panel options to the **Admin** region include smd_faux_role and wet_snitch.

fn4. The current version of Textpattern has a tertiary level of panels under the **Preferences** link: **Basic** (default), **Advanced**, and **Update languages**. Beginning with Textpattern 4.6, the **Basic** and **Advanced** panels will merge into a single, functional **Preferences** panel, and **Update languages** will become a new panel called **Languages** under the **Admin** region. The tree above shows the new 4.6 organization.

h3(#sec2-4). Extensions (not core)

The "**Extensions**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/extensionswill region is not an out-of-the-box feature of Textpattern, but it will appear to site administrators and Publishers if any of the admin-side plugins that make use of it are installed. The following table shows a few examples of admin-side plugins that use the **Extensions** region. This is not a complete list, nor trying to be; it's for demonstration purposes only. If a plugin provides an **Extensions** panel, it will be indicated in the associated plugin instructions.  

notextile. <div class="tabular-data" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Table">

|_. Plugin |_. Extensions panel label[5] |
| "arc_redirect":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=36705 | arc_redirect |
| "ied_plugin_composer":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=14898 | Plugin Composer |
| "smd_bio":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=31496 | Bio config |
| "smd_where_used":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=27493 | Where used |

The use of the **Extensions** region is basically a convention adopted by plugin developers to put administration-side plugin preferences and other functional controls in a logical place. Not all administration-side plugins use the **Extensions** region, however. Some will add their associated admin-side functionality as a panel in one of the other core regions. This typically happens when the plugin developer feels the functionality more closely associates with _content_, _presentation_, or _admin_ functionality.[6] 

fn5. Plugin developers should follow Textpattern's "editorial style guidelines":http://docs.textpattern.io/brand/editorial-style-guidelines for UI elements to ensure their plugins elements have consistent appearance with Textpattern's core presentation. With respect to UI titles, headings, and labels this means 1) not using abbreviations, and 2) using sentence-case (not capital-case or "code_case"). In the table above, for example, the labels "arc_redirect", "Plugin Composer", and "Bio config" should be "Redirects" (or "URL redirects"), "Plugin composer", and "Bio configuration", respectively. You are encouraged to let plugin developers know (by posting in the appropriate "plugin support threads":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewforum.php?id=79) when the appearance of their plugins' UI elements are not conventional in any way.  

fn6. Another reason plugin panels end up in core regions is concern for the potential of having too many plugin panels under the **Extensions** region. Most likely this is an unwarranted concern for 99% of Textpattern's users. Either way, it can be a little confusing if you're expecting to find plugin functionality under **Extensions** but it's mixed in with the core panels. The issue is still evolving and will likely end up at a more regimented process for plugin developers.  

h2(#sec3). Changing default login panel

The default admin-side landing location changes once you initially set your language preferences. You'll find yourself landing on the "**Write**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/write-panel panel from that point on, which is the default panel under the **Content** region.

You can change the default landing panel to whatever admin-side panel you want. In "**Preferences**":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/preferences-panel, look under the **Admin** area for "Default administration panel".[7] Use the drop-down menu to select the panel you want, then save.

fn7. The current preference label is, "Default admin tab". Beginning with version 4.6 the label will become "Default administration panel", which is a normalization against "Textpattern guidelines":http://docs.textpattern.io/brand/.

h1. Textpattern administration [todo:dw]

The administration side of Textpattern (often called "admin-side") is where the website administrator (perhaps you) -- as well as any additional "users":administration/users/index.textile having the right kind of access -- manages the Textpattern installation.

h2. Admin-side login

Textpattern is typically installed in the root web location of a website's domain, which puts the login location at __domain.tld/textpattern__.

<aside class="tipbox">See "Textpattern security":security/index.textile if you're worried about the login location being common knowledge.</aside>

When you install Textpattern and login for the first time (or when you first login after upgrading an installation), the default view will be in the "admin":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=admin area, specifically at the "language_preferences":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=language_preferences view where you need to install/update the languages you choose to use (Figure 2).

From there you should configure your "basic_preferences":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=basic_preferences, check/troubleshoot "diagnostics":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=diagnostics as needed, and then tackle setting up site architecture and presentation with a little trial and error. The latter is a big chunk of learning and doing and there's no direct 1-2-3 method for it, but this wiki is here, the learning is fun, and once you understand how it all fits together you'll thank yourself for choosing such an elegant system.

h3(sectionedit3#routine_login_landing_point). Routine Login Landing Point

After your initial login, all other admin-side visits will default you directly in the "content":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=content tab's "write":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=write panel, which will be convenient later when all you need to do is write articles (Figure 3).

You can optionally change the location of your login landing point from the "advanced_preferences":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=advanced_preferences tab in the "admin":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=admin area: set the _Default admin tab_ dropdown to your preferred page.

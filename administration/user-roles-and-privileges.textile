h1. User roles and privileges

In addition to the administrator (the most powerful type of Textpattern account), several pre-defined user roles are provided for in Textpattern out-of-the-box. Each role has an associated set of administration privileges that are meant to help with leveraging the different responsibilities in a collaborative publishing workflow. If you're building a Textpattern website for yourself (single user), you wouldn't need to concern yourself with these roles. But if you're building a platform to support multi-user contributions, user roles and privileges may be an important factor in your publishing architecture design.

h2(#sec1). Account classifications versus roles

It's helpful to classify user accounts in three ways. 

First is the all-powerful *administrator account*. Only one person has this account; the person who installed Textpattern (presumably you). Though an administrator can certainly serve in a publishing role, an administrator isn't necessarily part of a collaborative publishing process; they are more like the one to get in touch with if there's a problem with the website's installation. They typically handle all server-side issues, update the system when new releases are made, backup the database on a regular schedule, and make decisions about website "security":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/security. If a website is only a single-user site, this is the only account you need.

Second are the *collaborative (publishing) accounts*, which represent the six _roles_ defined in Textpattern, from Publisher down to Designer. The roles are primarily what this page is concerned with. Collaborator roles are taken into consideration when planning a publishing architecture around the day-to-day activities of producing content (and evolving the presentation).[1]

Finally there are (potentially) *frozen accounts*, which have the status of "None", meaning the accounts are preserved but the account holders are denied access to the administration side. This is useful for accounts that publish content (e.g., a magazine editor) but later leave the editorial team. Their content will remain safely on the public side of the website, under the authoring name.

fn1. The "smd_user_manager":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=36558 and "smd_bio":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=31496 plugins can be installed and used to expand user account data and produce published bios or user profiles generated from the expanded data.

h2(#sec2). Panel access per publishing role

The following table shows the three account classifications described above -- including the six collaborator/publishing roles from Publisher to Designer) -- versus access to administration panels and functionality:[2]

* %(success)Full% means the account or role can access the panel and has no restrictions to functionality. See associated panel documentation in that case. 
* %(warning)Limited% means the account or role can access the panel but does not have full read or write access to all functionality. See the "limited access" descriptions in following sections. 
* %(error)Blocked% means the account or role has no panel access and can not see the panel link in the administration UI. (For accounts with "None" status, the account is no longer usable; the former user can not log in at all.)

fn2. You may also install and use the "smd_faux_role":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=33462&p=2 plugin to more easily visualize what a given role can see and do in the administration side. However it's most effective when multiple user accounts exist and they have varying kinds of content contribution histories to compare against. The plugin ensures the administrator's status is not lost and can easily switch back to a Publisher's perspective (can see all functionality) at any time, even between logged-out sessions. 

h2(#sec3). Limited access specifications

For each publishing role having %(warning)Limited% access to a panel, the specific rights and restrictions for that panel are clarified in the following sections.

h3(#sec3-1). Publisher

Like the administrator, the Publisher is all-powerful with respect to administration-side functionality, except a Publisher cannot delete the administrator's account, whereas an administrator can certainly delete the publisher's. However, these roles don't compete. Unlike administrators (an account type described earlier), Publishers represent the top position of the editorial team, which is focused on website architecture, content, and design. Publishers may not actually work on all those things -- from a collaborative standpoint they're more a decision maker than a doer -- but they have the power in the CMS to step in and override something if necessary. 

h3(#sec3-2). Managing Editor

Managing Editors are essentially the Publisher's right hand, a transition role from process governance to content production. Managing Editors have the same privileges as Publishers throughout the administration side, with one exception.

**Users** panel: They can see basic data types (Login, Real name, Email, Privileges, Last log in, etc) for all user accounts, and edit full account data for any inferior role, but cannot edit account data for Publishers or other Managing Editors.

h3(#sec3-3). Copy Editor

Copy Editors aren't concerned with governance, as the higher roles are, rather they're all about content production, in this case editing the content produced by writers and making final preparations and/or checks before publishing. Such preps and checks might include formatting copy and adding images (or verifying that it's been done correctly), assigning output designators (the section and categories fields), adding custom field data and metadata, setting publishing date, and so forth. Copy Editor privileges are pretty straight forward, either having full access to panels or no access at all, with one exception. 

**Users** panel: They can see basic data types for all user accounts, but they can only edit their own account data.

h3(#sec3-4). Staff Writer

The Staff Writer is one of two roles primarily concerned with writing articles (the other being Freelancer). They don't need access to much of the administration side except those panels concerned with content, with a few limitations.

**Write** panel: They can create, edit, publish, and delete their own articles. They can see the full articles of other user accounts, but not edit them in any way.

**Images** panel: They can upload images and edit the ones they upload. They can see the images uploaded by other user accounts, but they cannot edit or delete those images.

**Files** panel: They can upload files and edit the ones they upload. They can see the names of files uploaded by other user accounts, but they cannot edit or delete those files. [???]

**Users** panel: They can edit their own user account details, but not see anyone else's account information.

h3(#sec3-5). Freelancer

Freelancers are external to the website's editorial team. You can think of them as "guest authors". Like Staff Writers, Freelancers write articles, but that's mostly it due to their external status. 

**Write** panel: They can create new "Draft" articles and switch their status to "Pending", but not publish them "Live". They can see the full articles of other user accounts, but not edit them in any way.

**Users** panel: Same as Staff Writer.

h3(#sec3-6). Designer

A Designer's focus is uniquely on site structure and presentation, but a Designer can see some content too to help inform presentational decisions.

**Write** panel: They can see anyone's full article regardless of status, but not edit anyone else's articles in any way. Nor can a Designer create articles. 

**Users** panel: Same as Staff Writer.

h2(#sec4). Modifying user roles and privileges

You can go beyond assigning roles by installing the "smd_user_manager":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=36558 plugin and modify the default role titles, creating new role types, and changing the privileges a given role has. The plugin also allows creating custom user groups in addition to changing individual roles. Follow the instructions that come with the plugin.

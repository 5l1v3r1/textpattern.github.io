h1. User roles and privileges

Textpattern provides several pre-defined user roles out-of-the-box. Each role has an associated set of admin-side privileges that are meant to help with leveraging the different responsibilities in a publishing workflow.

On this page:

* "Panel access per role":#sec1
* "Limited access specifications":#sec2
* "Roles in terms of privileges":#sec3 [old lists]
** "Publisher":#sec3-1
** "Managing Editor":#sec3-2
** "Copy Editor":#sec3-3
** "Staff Writer":#sec3-4
** "Freelancer":#sec3-5
** "Designer":#sec3-6
** "None":#sec3-7

h2(#sec1). Panel access per role

The following table shows user roles versus access to administration panels. Access is either %(success)full%, %(warning)limited%, or %(error)none%.

fn1. "None":#sec2-7 is a role assignment, but has no access to any panels. It has value in collaborative publishing situations, like magazines, where writers may leave the team and thus shouldn't have administration access anymore, but their content must still be preserved and recognized on the public side by author name.

h2(#sec2). Limited access specifications

For each role having %(warning)limited% access to a panel, the specific elements they can see and use are detailed.

h3(#sec2-1). Role X

**{Panel}**

* element (how used)
* element (how used)
* element (how used)
* etc.

h3(#sec2-2). Role Y

**{Panel}**

* element (how used)
* element (how used)
* element (how used)
* etc.

[etc]

h2(#sec3). Privileges per role [old docs]

h3(#sec3-1). Publisher

The publisher role has the same rights and abilities as the administrator, with the sole exception that a publisher can not delete or demote the administrator account. The publisher can:

* create, edit or delete any article, link or comment
* change article status
* edit site preferences
* access all site design areas
* edit sections and categories
* add and remove other user accounts (except the administrator)
* grant and restrict privileges

h3(#sec3-2). Managing editor

The managing editor has fewer rights than the publisher, but can still:

* edit and delete any article, link or comment
* change article status from **Pending** to **Live**
* edit site preferences
* access all site design areas
* edit sections and categories

h3(#sec3-3). Copy editor

The copy editor can't work on site structure, presentation, or change preferences. Copy editors can only:

* edit article, links, or comments
* edit HTML in Page template and Forms

h3(#sec3-4). Staff writer

* can create, edit, publish and delete own articles
* can upload images

h3(#sec3-5). Freelancer

* can create and edit own articles
* can change article status from Draft to Pending

h3(#sec3-6). Designer

* can edit Page HTML, Forms, and CSS

h3(#sec3-7). None

This option allows removing all privileges on a given user account without actually deleting the account from the CMS. This is a good option, for example, if you run a multi-author site of some kind, and an author leaves the collaboration effort/team. You can freeze their account so they can't add/modify/undo anything, while still keepiong their name on their published work.

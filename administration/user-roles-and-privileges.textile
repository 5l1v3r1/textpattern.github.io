h1. User roles and privileges

Textpattern provides several pre-defined user roles out-of-the-box. Each role has an associated set of admin-side privileges that are meant to help with leveraging the different responsibilities in a collaborative publishing workflow.

h2(#sec2). Panel access per role

The following table shows user roles versus access to administration panels and functionality:

* %(success)Full% means the role can access panel and has no restrictions to functionality. See associated panel documentation in that case. 
* %(warning)Limited% means the role can access the panel but does not have full read or write access to all functionality. See the "limited access" descriptions in following sections. 
* %(error)Blocked% means the role has no panel access and can not see the panel link in the administration UI.

fn1. "None":#sec2-7 is a **Privileges** assignment option, but has no access to any panels. It has value in collaborative publishing situations, like magazines, where writers may leave the team and shouldn't have administration access anymore, but their published articles must remain and be recognized. 

h2(#sec3). Limited access specifications

For each role having %(warning)Limited% access to a panel, the specific rights and restrictions are clarified.

h3(#sec3-1). Managing Editor

Managing Editors have the same level of rights as Publishers throughout the administration side, with the exception of the "Users":users-panel. The difference are:

* Can see default data for all user accounts. 
* Can see and edit full account data for any inferior role.[2]
* Can _not_ edit account data for Publishers or other Managing Editors.

fn2. If a website is using the smd_user_manager and smd_bio plugins to expand user account data, the Managing Editor can see and edit the expanded data fields too, beyond just the default data types.

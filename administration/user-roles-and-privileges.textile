h1. User roles and privileges

In addition to the administrator (the most powerful type of Textpattern account), several pre-defined user roles are provided for in Textpattern out-of-the-box. Each role has an associated set of administration privileges that are meant to help with leveraging the different responsibilities in a collaborative publishing workflow. If you're building a Textpattern website for yourself (single user), you wouldn't need to concern yourself with these roles. But if you're building a platform to support multi-user contributions, user roles and privileges may be an important factor in your publishing architecture design.

h2(#sec1). Account classifications versus roles

There is no physical distinction between Textpattern user accounts, but it's helpful to classify accounts in three ways when talking about individual roles: administrator, collaborative (or _publishing_), and frozen. 

The *administrator account* is all-powerful, and only one person has this account -- the person who installed Textpattern initially (presumably you). Although administrators can certainly serve in a publishing role, the administrator isn't necessarily part of a collaborative publishing process; they are more like the person to get in touch with if there's a problem with the website's installation. They have the duty of regularly backing up the database and updating the system when new releases are made. Likewise, they typically handle all server-side issues, and will make decisions about website "security":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/security.

The *collaborative (publishing) accounts* represent the actual _roles_ and their associated privileges defined in Textpattern. The roles are primarily what this page is concerned with -- from Publisher down to Designer. These roles are what would be taken into consideration when planning a publishing architecture for a multi-contributor website, primarily around the day-to-day activities of producing content and evolving the presentation.[1]

The *frozen accounts* represent former collaborator accounts that no longer participate in the publishing process. They no longer have association with the website. In this case, frozen accounts are given the status of "None", meaning they have no access rights to administration functionality. This status is useful if former collaborators published content and that content needs to remain on the public side under the author's name. Accounts with a "None" essentially keeps the content produced from those accounts safe from the departed collaborators.

fn1. The "smd_user_manager":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=36558 and "smd_bio":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=31496 plugins can be installed and used to expand user account data and produce published bios or user profiles generated from the expanded data.

h2(#sec2). Panel access per publishing role

The following table shows the three account classifications described above (including the collaborator/publishing roles from Publisher to Designer) versus access to administration panels and functionality:[2]

* %(success)Full% means the account or role can access the panel and has no restrictions to functionality. See associated panel documentation in that case. 
* %(warning)Limited% means the account or role can access the panel but does not have full read or write access to all functionality. See the "limited access" descriptions in following sections. 
* %(error)Blocked% means the account or role has no panel access and can not see the panel link in the administration UI. (For accounts with "None" status, the account is no longer usable; the former user can not log in at all.)

fn2. In addition to this documentation, an administrator can directly see the specific functionality a given collaborator role has by installing the "smd_faux_role":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=33462&p=2 plugin and following the instructions. The plugin ensures the administrator's status is not lost and can easily switch back to a Publisher's perspective (can see all functionality) at any time, even between logged-out sessions. 

h2(#sec3). Limited access specifications

For each publishing role having %(warning)Limited% access to a panel, the specific rights and restrictions are clarified.

h3(#sec3-1). Publisher

Like the administrator, the Publisher is all-powerful with respect to administration-side functionality. However, a Publisher cannot delete the administrator's account, whereas an administrator can certainly delete the publisher's.

h3(#sec3-2). Managing Editor

Managing Editors equal Publishers throughout the administration side, but with slightly less rights on the "**Users**":users-panel panel. They can see default data for _all_ user accounts, and edit full account data for any inferior role, but cannot edit account data for Publishers or other Managing Editors.

h3(#sec3-3). Copy Editor [todo]

The copy editor can't work on site structure, presentation, or change preferences. Copy editors can only:

* edit article, links, or comments
* edit HTML in Page template and Forms

h3(#sec3-4). Staff Writer [todo]

* can create, edit, publish and delete own articles
* can upload images

h3(#sec3-5). Freelancer [todo]

* can create and edit own articles
* can change article status from Draft to Pending

h3(#sec3-6). Designer

The Designer blocked from all panels except Pages, Forms, and Styles, where they can work on markup and CSS, and the can access the Users panel to edit their own account details.

h2(#sec4). Modifying user roles and privileges

You can modify the default roles and privileges by installing the "smd_user_manager":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=36558 plugin, which allows creating custom user groups in addition to changing the roles and rights of individuals. Follow the instructions that come with the plugin.

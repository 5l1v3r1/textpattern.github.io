This panel will show a list of all your existing articles together with basic information (ID#, Posted, Title, Section, Status and Author). Details can optionally be displayed. From this list you can

* open an article for editing.
* perform changes on selected articles.

Because the article list can get pretty long, the Search function is the first thing to be seen at the top.

h4(#search_function). Search function

You can use the Search function to

* *locate* an article directly by search phrase
* or to *filter* the view on your articles by particular criteria, thus reducing the number of articles in the resulting list.

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:articles-search-en.png!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:articles-search-en.png

The Search function has two components:

* A drop-down-list to specify which area is to be searched
* and a textarea for entering the search query.

Query text entered in the textarea will be treated as a _complete phrase_ (e.g. “time stamp” will find exactly that. Text containing only “time” or “stamp”, “time, stamp” or “timestamp” will not be in the results.). You don't need to wildcard query text at the beginning or the end (e.g. “time” will find “parttime”, “times”, “timestamp” as well). But you can use wildcard ? within a query.

After entering your search criteria you start searching by clicking “Go”. As a result you will be given a new list of articles which meet the criteria.

As a default the search will find entered text in the articles' title, body and excerpt. But you can do more refined searches by selecting another area to search in. The drop-down-list left from the textarea provides the following search criteria:

* ID#
* Title, Body &amp; Excerpt (default)
* Section
* Categories
* Keywords
* Status
* Author
* Article image
* Posted
* Modified

Examples: You can search (or list) an article by its ID# or date posted. You can list all articles of an author, you even don't need the full author ID. Choose “Author” and typing “adm” possibly is enough for the admin (provided no other author has “adm” in his ID). You can list all “Drafts” (choose “Status” and type “dr”).

h4(#list_of_articles). List of articles

Okay, back to the list of articlesâ€¦ Each row is one article.

To explain the _columns_ going across the top: (Note: The columns can be sorted. If you click the header of a column, it will sort the list of articles according to that column. Click again to reverse sort direction. The current sort column is marked by a yellow arrow on the right side of its name indicating its direction.)

The default view shows these columns:

*ID#* â€“ an ID number is automatically assigned to each article. This is what identifies it and calls it on the live site.

*Posted* â€“ this is the date/time that the article was (or will be) published. If it shows on the live site depends on your forms. Articles to be published in the future (where you entered a timestamp manually) are shown gray instead of black.

*Title* â€“ the title of the article. Click this to edit the article.

*Section* â€“ the section that the article belongs to.

*Status* â€“ this is the status of the article. if set to Live, then this article is viewable on your live site (except if it has expired, see "expired":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=expired). Might otherwise be set to Draft, or Pending, etc.

*Author* â€“ this is the login name of the person who posted the article

At the bottom of the list there is an option “Show Detail”. When marked additional columns (and two links) will be presented (new ones in bold):

ID# â€“ Beneath the ID two links will be added for each article: *Edit* â€“ click this (or the title of the article) to edit the article. *View* â€“ click this to view the particular article on the live site.

Posted â€“ see above

*Modified* â€“ tells when the article has recently been modified

*Expires* â€“ If an expire date/time has been entered for an article it will be shown here

Title â€“ see above

Section â€“ see above

*Category 1* â€“ if the article was assigned a category, then it will reflect that here.

*Category 2* â€“ if the article was assigned a second category, it will reflect that here.

Status â€“ see above

Author â€“ see above

*Comments* â€“ this will show if the article has comments turned on or off, and how many comments have been made to this article.

h4(#perform_changes_on_selected_articles). Perform changes on selected articles

On the left side you will find a checkbox for each article. Here you can select articles you want to change in a jointly manner. You can mark articles by ckecking the checkbox or you can use the checkbox in the head bar of the list to mark all articles on that page.

In order to quickly select ranges of articles click the checkbox of the first article you want to mark, press and hold the shift key, then click the checkbox of the last article in the range. All articles between will be checked too. You can add ranges to your selection by repeating these steps.

For performing changes now you go to the drop-down-list “with selected” and choose the function you want to perform. The following changes are available:

* Change section
* Change Category1
* Change Category2
* Change status
* Change comments
* Change author
* Delete

When selecting a “Change”-option you will get another drop-down-list below which will give you the values to choose from, e.g. the list of authors, sections or a On/Off for comments. After selecting the options you want to perform click “Go” to start the changes. A pop-up window will ask “Are you sure?” and then (if “yes”) the changes will be performed.

h4(#pages_and_articles_per_page). Pages and Articles per page

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:articles-cataloguenavigatio.png!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:articles-cataloguenavigatio.png

At the very bottom of the list you will find a pagination and links for next and previous pages if there are more pages. By default Textpattern will show 25 articles per page. You can change the number of articles per page by selecting another value in the drop-down-list “View # per page”: 15, 25, 50 and 100.

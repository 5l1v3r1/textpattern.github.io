This **Languages** panel is where you update your chosen language pack (also called "Textpack") after installing and updating Textpattern. The language you activated during your initial installation of Textpattern will be indicated as "Up-to-date". You can also install a new language textpack here anytime, such as for multi-lingual publishing efforts.

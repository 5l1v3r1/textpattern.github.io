# Pages panel

The **Pages** panel contains an edit field, a list of existing [Page templates](http://docs.textpattern.io/themes/page-templates-explained), and a tag builder to help you construct page content. It's important to note that, like everything else, the Page templates are stored in the database - there is no physical file on the server that contains this Page template.

The first column of the page is the list of known pages. To select a template for editing, click on the name in the first column and Textpattern will fill the second column edit field with the selected template.

The second column is a large edit field where you may edit the Page template code, and controls for creating a brand new Page template or creating a copy of an existing Page template. A Save button, located at the bottom of the second column, will save the Page template back into the Textpattern database.

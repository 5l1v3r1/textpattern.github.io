# Pages panel

The Pages administration panel contains an edit field, a list of existing [Page templates](http://docs.textpattern.io/themes/page-templates-explained), and a tag builder to help you construct page content. It's important to note that, like everything else, the Page templates are stored in the database - there is no physical file on the server that contains this Page template.

The first column of the panel is the list of current Page templates. To select a template for editing, click on the name in the first column and Textpattern will fill the second column edit field with the selected template.

The second column is a large edit field where you may edit the Page template code, and controls for creating a brand new Page template or creating a copy of an existing Page template. A Save button, located at the bottom of the second column, will save the Page template back into the Textpattern database.

## Creating a new Page template

To create a new Page template, click the 'Create new page' button. The Page template editor will be empty. Before working on the Page template content, it's best to first give it an unique name and save it, all using the controls in the Page template editor.

You can then go back to editing the Page template's content, either by hand, or by pasting in some starter code from an existing Page template and editing it as needed. Be sure to save your changes as you progress to not risk losing anything!

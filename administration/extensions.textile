h1. Extensions

The **Extensions** region is not an out-of-the-box feature. It appears to the higher "user roles":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/user-roles-and-privileges if any of the admin-side plugins that employ it are installed. 

When relevant, the **Extensions** region will be seen in the administration navigation from all admin-side views _except_ when you are in context of the **Plugins** panel, even for the administrator. This behaviour ensures being able to safely deactivate and/or remove outdated or buggy plugins if they are causing problems. To access the **Extensions** panels from the **Plugins** panel, click anywhere else in the admin-side navigation first and the **Extensions* region will appear.

h2. Plugins that use the Extensions region

When you upload a plugin that uses the **Extensions** region, a new panel option will appear under the region that provides the associated functionality or configuration controls for that plugin. The following table identifies the _supported_ plugins that will do this, and their corresponding panel labels. (Orphaned or otherwise abandoned plugins are not listed here, intentionally. Nevertheless, it's up to you to research the plugins that are listed to ensure they are viable and working before installing.)

fn1. Plugin developers should follow Textpattern's "editorial style guidelines":http://docs.textpattern.io/brand/editorial-style-guidelines for UI elements to ensure their plugins elements have consistent appearance with Textpattern's core presentation. With respect to UI titles, headings, and labels this means 1) not using abbreviations, and 2) using sentence-case (not capital-case or "code_case"). In the table above, for example, the labels "arc_redirect", "Plugin Composer", and "Bio config" would ideally be "URL redirects" (to distinguish it from the label for smd_redirects), "Plugin composer", and "Bio configuration", respectively. You are encouraged to let plugin developers know (by posting in the appropriate "plugin support threads":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewforum.php?id=79) when the appearance of their plugins' UI elements are not satisfying the expected convention.

fn2. This plugin provides functionality that may arrive in core by Textpattern version 4.6 or the version after.

h2. Unconventional panel placement

The use of the **Extensions** region is basically a convention adopted by plugin developers to put administration-side plugin preferences and other functional controls in a logical place, and that's a good thing when it can be done. 

Not all administration-side plugins use the **Extensions** region, however. Some will add their associated admin-side functionality as a panel in one of the other core regions. This typically happens when panel placement is decided on by functional context over convention. Another reason plugin panels end up somewhere else is concern for having too many plugin panels under the **Extensions** region. Most likely this is a moot issue for 99% of Textpattern users, thus not a warranted reason at all. 

Either way, it can be a little confusing when your hunting for plugin panel functionality and it's not where you expect it to be. The issue is still evolving and plugin developers will likely settle on a standard process eventually, as well on a convention for creating plugin panel labels.

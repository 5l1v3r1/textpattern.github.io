# Languages panel

The **Languages** panel is where you update your chosen language pack (also called a "Textpack") after installing and updating Textpattern.

The language you activated during your initial installation of Textpattern will be indicated as "Up-to-date". You can also install a new language Textpack here anytime, such as for multi-lingual publishing efforts.

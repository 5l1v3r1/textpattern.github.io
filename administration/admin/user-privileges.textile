h1. User roles and associated privileges

Textpattern provides several types of user account roles, out-of-the-box. These roles and their associated abilitities are described here from most powerful to least.

h2. Administrator

The administrator is the person who installs and configures the Textpattern software on a web server. As the first user account in the system, the administrator can access and modify any feature, as well create, manage, and delete other user accounts. The administrator is the most powerful user.

h2. Publisher

The publisher role has the same rights and abilities as the administrator -- no restrictions to any location or feature -- with the sole exception that a publisher can not delete or demote the adminstrator account.

This option allows removing all privileges on a given user account without actually deleting the account from the CMS. This is a good option, for example, if you run a multi-author site of some kind, and an author leaves the collaboration effort/team. You can freeze their account so they can't add/modify/undo anything, while still keepiong their name on their past published work.

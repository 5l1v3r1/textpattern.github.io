h1. User roles and associated privileges

Textpattern provides several types of user account roles, out-of-the-box. These roles and their associated abilitities are described here from most powerful to least.

h2. Administrator

The administrator is the person who installs and configures the Textpattern software on a web server. As the first user account in the system, the administrator can access and modify any feature, as well create, manage, and delete other user accounts. The administrator is the most powerful user.

h2. Publisher

The publisher role has the same rights and abilities as the administrator -- no restrictions to any location or feature -- with the sole exception that a publisher can not delete or demote the adminstrator account. In short, the publisher can:

* create, edit or delete any article, link or comment
* change article status
* edit site preferences
* access all site design areas
* edit sections and categories
* add and remove other user accounts (except the administrator)
* grant and restrict privileges

h2. Managing editor

The managing editor has fewer rights than the publisher, but can still:

* edit and delete any article, link or comment
* change article status from **Pending** to **Live**
* edit site preferences
* access all site design areas
* edit sections and categories

h2. Copy editor

The copy editor can't work on site structure, presentation, or change preferences. Copy editors can only:

* edit article, links, or comments
* edit HTML in Page template and Forms

h2. Staff writer

* can create, edit, publish and delete own articles
* can upload images

h2. Freelancer

* can create and edit own articles
* can change article status from Draft to Pending

h2. Designer

* can edit Page HTML, Forms, and CSS

h2. None

This option allows removing all privileges on a given user account without actually deleting the account from the CMS. This is a good option, for example, if you run a multi-author site of some kind, and an author leaves the collaboration effort/team. You can freeze their account so they can't add/modify/undo anything, while still keepiong their name on their past published work.

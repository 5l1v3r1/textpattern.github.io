Textpattern's _import_ features allow you to import Weblog articles from another Weblog system.

*Note:* Few Weblog systems are supported at this time, but more will be added as time goes by. You can help "Textpattern Developers":http://team.textpattern.com increase the system options by writing your own script for a missing system, which can be refined and added to the Textpattern core.

h3(sectionedit1#panel_controls). Panel Controls

The import panel is pretty simple, consisting of just four controls (Figure 2), which are described in the following sections.

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:tab_admin_import_fig02-controls.png!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:tab_admin_import_fig02-controls.png

h4(#import_from_1). Import from (1)

The first control is a dropdown box that lists the various systems Textpattern supports at any given time (Figure 3).

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:tab_admin_import_fig03-impfrom.png!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:tab_admin_import_fig03-impfrom.png

For each system supported, there is generally one of two ways the publishing system data is imported, either via a _text file_ or via a _MySQL database_, and sometimes, as in the case of Movable Type, both methods are supported as indicated in Figure 3. If a system does not indicate which mode is supported in the dropdown options, it could be one or the other, but not both.

For clarity, the supported modes for the existing system options are as follows:

* Movable Type (file or database)
* Blogger (file or database)
* b2 (database)
* Wordpress (database)

h4(#section_to_import_into_2). Section to import into (2)

The second control is a dropdown box that simply lists all the Sections that you currently have created in Textpattern (Figure 4).

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:tab_admin_import_fig04-sections.png!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:tab_admin_import_fig04-sections.png

*Note:* Sections are what you create in the "sections":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=sections tab.

h4(#default_article_status_3). Default article status (3)

The *Default article status* control is a dropdown box that lists Textpattern's article status options (Figure 5). These are the same options you choose from when first drafting an article in the "write":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=write tab.

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:tab_admin_import_fig05-status.png!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:tab_admin_import_fig05-status.png

h4(#default_comments_invite_4). Default comments invite (4)

The *Default comments invite* control is a text box that allows you to create a custom label for the _comments invite_ link that will appear for your respective articles (Figure 6).

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:tab_admin_import_fig06-invite.png!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:tab_admin_import_fig06-invite.png

*Note:* The comments invite can be controlled in two other locations in Textpattern. The first is in the Comments section of the "basic_preferences":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=basic_preferences, which controls the invite label and other comment settings for the entire site by default. The second is in the "write":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=write tab, where you can set the invite label for each new article you write.

h3(sectionedit2#the_process). The Process

h4(#importing_from_a_text_file). Importing from a Text File

Importing systems via a text file (such as for Movable Type and Blogger) can be done by first exporting data into a text file, which in turn can be imported into Textpattern. Do this as follows:

<ol>
<li><p>Name the textfile</p>
bc. import.txt


<p>and place the file in the directory located at _&lt;code&gt;/textpattern/include/import/&lt;/code&gt;_.</p></li>
<li>Go to the Import subtab (the panel you are reading about now), and make the appropriate selections as described under the _Controls_ section above (Figures 3 through 6).</li>
<li><p>Click the _Continue_ button. Textpattern will use your text file</p>
bc. import.txt


<p>and import it's contents into the Textpattern database structure. You get a list of imported articles with a message at the end about the status of the action.</p></li>
</ol>

When it's done, you can go the the "articles":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=articles tab and see all your articles are now listed, which should be the case if all went reasonably well.

* "importing_from_b2":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=importing_from_b2
* "importing_from_movable_type":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=importing_from_movable_type
* "importing_from_word_press":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=importing_from_word_press

h4(#importing_from_a_mysql_database). Importing from a MySQL database

When you select a system from the dropdown _Import from_ options (Figure 3) that is a database option, a new set of controls will appear under the regular tab controls. The controls will consist of a common set of configuration fields for all imported systems (Figure 7).

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:tab_admin_import_fig07-dbdetails.png!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:tab_admin_import_fig07-dbdetails.png

However, depending on which system you are importing, there may be an additional field specific to that system, which is talked about shortly in the following sections.

In any case, you begin for all systems by filling in the common database information indicated in Figure 7. _Movable Type_ and _WordPress_ each has an additional, unique field to address in the *Database Data* controls.

For _Movable Type_ it will be a control called *Weblog ID* (Figure 8).

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:tab_admin_import_fig08-mtfield.gif!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:tab_admin_import_fig08-mtfield.gif

For _Wordpress_ it will be a control for *table prefix* (Figure 9). Most likely you can leave the default

bc. wp_


if you haven't changed that when you installed WordPress (you might have changed it if your WordPress site shared the database with another application).

"!/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=file:tab_admin_import_fig09-wpfield.gif!":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/lib/exe/detail.php?id=&media=file:tab_admin_import_fig09-wpfield.gif

Fill in the information accordingly and press the _Continue_ button.

Textpattern will connect to your old database and import the external system's contents into the Textpattern database structure. You get a list of imported articles with a message at the end about the status of the action.

When it's done, you can go the the articles tab and see if all went well. If so, congratualations and welcome to Textpattern.

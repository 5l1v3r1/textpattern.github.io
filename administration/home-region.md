# Home region TODO

The Home region is not an out-of-the-box feature. It appears to the higher [user roles](https://docs.textpattern.io/administration/user-roles-and-privileges) if any of the admin-side plugins that employ it are installed.

\[When relevant, the **Home** region will be seen in the administration
navigation from all admin-side views *except* when you are in context of
the **Plugins** panel, even for the administrator. This behaviour
ensures being able to safely deactivate and/or remove outdated or buggy
plugins if they are causing problems. To access the **Home** panels from
the **Plugins** panel, move to anywhere else in the admin-side first,
and the \***Extensions** region will appear in the navigation again.\]
**Is this paragraph true?**

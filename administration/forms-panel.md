# Forms panel TODO

The Forms administration panel contains an edit field, a list of existing [Form templates](http://docs.textpattern.io/themes/form-templates-explained) organized by rough categories, and a tag builder to help you construct form content. It's important to note that, like everything else, the Form templates are stored in the database - there is no physical file on the server that contains this Page template.

## Creating a new Form template

To create a new Form template, click the **Create new form** button at the top of
the right column. The Form editor will be empty. Before working on the
Form content right away, it's best to first give it an unique name,
assign a Form type and save it, all using the controls under the Form
editor.

You can then go back to editing the Form's content, either by hand, or
by pasting in some starter code from an existing Form and editing it as
needed. Be sure to save your changes as you progress to not risk losing
anything.

All Forms need to have unique names and a Form type association before
saving them. should classify it according to the kind of *Form* it will
be. There are seven form types: **article**, **category**, **comment**,
**file**, **link**, **misc** (miscellaneous), and **section**. The form type you
use is not vitally important, the purpose of assigning forms a type is
to allow Textpattern's tag builder to help you easily find the form you
want to use. Once you've named and classified your form, you can begin
building it.

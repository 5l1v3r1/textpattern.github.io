"links":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=links provides a way of keeping track of links and lists of resources (often external to the site) so they may be included in articles or form content in a convenient way.

While you could place links to external resources (or internal pages) directly into any article this would mean a lot of work keeping track and maintaining links and lists of recources. Textpattern provides a much better way: Manage your links (and lists of links) _in a central place_ and then include them in article or form content with tags. This way changes will take effect at every occurence of a link and - for example - additions to a topic list of resource links will automatically be included wherever you placed the list.

On this panel you can do two basic things:

* _Create_ a new link and _edit_ existing ones
* and _manage_ your existing links.

(So the link panel in a way combines what for _articles_ is divided in two panels “Write” and “Article”.)

The first option is to create or edit a link - with the controls at the top of the panel:

h3(sectionedit1#link_controls). Link Controls

If the following controls are *empty* - by default when you just opened the panel or when you click on “Links” tab - you can use them to *create* a new link. Just fill in the appropriate fields and click “Save”. You do not need to fill in all information at once. If you have one of them, a link will be created and you can fill in the missing information later. If you open a link from the list below for editing, the existing link information will be shown in these controls and you can edit and save them.

Each link has various pieces of information associated with it, as described here:

** Title **
 the text that will be displayed for your link ** Sort Value **
 assigns listing priorities by number or letter to your links. See below for an explanation ** URL **
 the hyperlink value assigned to the link ** Category **
 the category to assign to the link. Categories must be created on the "categories":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=categories screen before they appear in the list. Link categories can be used with tags (as an attribute) to organize link lists ** Description **
 optional way of describing what the link is about. If used, it will be set as the anchor “title” attribute

h4(#sorting_rules). Sorting rules

When Textpattern sets the list sequence of links it uses the following method:

Numbers are considered lower than letters, and values are sequenced lowest to highest, top to bottom.

The first character on the left is considered first and all links are sequenced. Then the second character is considered, and those link values that have the same first character are sequenced like a sub category according to the second character. Then the third character is considered, then the fourth, etc.

Thus the sort values: 1, 1B, 2 10, 11, 100, 101, A, B would be sequenced as follows.

* 1
* 10
* 100
* 101
* 11
* 1B
* 2
* A
* B

h3(sectionedit2#table_of_existing_links). Table of existing Links

Beneath the link controls and the “Save” button a table (list) presents your existing links.

h4(#search_and_filter_function). Search and filter function

Because this list can get pretty long, there is a *Search function* at the top, which you can use to

* *locate* links individually by search phrases
* or to *filter* the list below (quite similar to the "articles":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=articles panel).

The Search function has two components:

* A _drop-down-list_ to specify which area is to be searched
* and a _textarea_ for entering the search phrase.

Text entered in the textarea will be treated as a complete phrase (see "articles":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=articles for details on this).

After entering your search criteria you start searching by clicking “Go”. As a result you will be given a new list of links which meet the criteria.

As a default the search will normally proceed in the links' *title*, which the drop-down-list indicates a bit unclearly by “name” (remember: name and title is very different in Categories). But you can do more refined searches by selecting another area to search in. The drop-down-list left from the textarea provides the following search criteria:

* ID#
* Name
* Description
* Category

h4(#table_of_links). Table of Links

Each row is one link. The columns provide basic information about the link. (Note: The columns can be sorted. If you click the header of a column, it will sort the list of links according to that column. Click again to reverse sort direction. The current sort column is marked by a yellow arrow on the right side of its name indicating its direction.)

The default view shows five columns:

*ID#* â€“ an ID number is automatically assigned to each link. This is what identifies it and calls it on the live site. Right from the ID# two links reside: _Edit_ â€“ click this (or the title of the link) to edit the link. _View_ â€“ click this to view the particular article on the live site.

*Name* â€“ the title (!) of the link. Click this to edit the link.

*Description* â€“ what has been told about the link, its character, any recommendations.

*Category* â€“ if the link was assigned a category, then it will reflect that here.

*Date* - the day and time when this link has been created.

h4(#perform_changes_on_selected_links). Perform changes on selected links

On the right side you will find a checkbox for each link. Here you can select links you want to change in a jointly manner. You can mark links by ckecking the checkbox or you can use select-buttons at the bottom of the list: “All”, “None” or “Range”. If you want to select a range you simply mark the checkbox of both the first and the last link in the range and then click “Range”. The links between will automatically be checked too.

For performing changes now you go to the drop-down-list “with selected” and choose the function you want to perform. The following changes are available:

* Change Category
* Delete

When selecting the “Change Category”-option you will get another drop-down-list below which will give you the list of categories to choose from.

After selecting the options you want to perform click “Go” to start the changes. A pop-up window will ask “Are you sure?” and then (if “yes”) the changes will be performed.

h3(sectionedit3#pagination). Pagination

At the very bottom of the list you will find a pagination and links for next and previous pages if there are more pages. By default Textpattern will show 25 links per page. You can also change the number of links per page by selecting another value in the drop-down-list “View # per page”: 15, 25, 50 and 100.

h3(sectionedit4#related_textpattern_tag). Related Textpattern Tag

"linklist":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=linklist will output links from the link repository, with filter criteria and presentation settings applied.

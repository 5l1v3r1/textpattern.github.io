The [styles](/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=styles) panel
has the familiar layout of
[pages](/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=pages). On the
right there is the list of the currently known stylesheets. On the left
there are controls for creating a brand new stylesheet, and on the
bottom there is a control for creating a copy of an existing style
sheet. Please note here again there is a status line in the upper left
that tells you which one you are currently editing in the box.

Smack in the middle is a large edit field where you may edit the CSS
directly. This is the default and is familiar to most people. If you so
choose, there is another option, a CSS style editor. On the left there
is a link entitled “Edit in CSS editor”. Upon clicking this link you are
presented with a long table where Textpattern has smartly parsed out
each element and each style for that element and made them individually
accessible. I highly recommend editing the raw CSS file however, so
click the “Edit raw CSS” and we can move along.

# Styles panel

The **Styles** panel is used to edit CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for your web site, and has a similar layout to the [Pages panel](http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/pages-panel).

Note: For performance benefits, you may wish to host your CSS as flat files (outside of the Textpattern database) instead of using this panel.
{: .alert-block .information}

The first column is the list of the current style sheets, as well as an indication of which one you are currently editing.

The second column is a large edit field where you may edit the CSS directly, and controls for creating a brand new style sheet or creating a copy of an existing style sheet. Standard CSS rules can be entered here.

The Presentation tab is a main-level tab composed of various sub-tabs for each of Textpattern's presentational building-blocks; in other words, the things that control the location, layout and appearance of your content. The sub-tabbed areas are indicated below and described in detail.

* "sections":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=sections
* "pages":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=pages
* "forms":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=forms
* "styles":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=styles

*Note:* It can  -  and has been  -  argued that "forms":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=forms are more a content item than a presentational item, as they more often than not represent packaged chunks of content, and thus should exist in the "content":/home/www/zendstudio/dokuwiki/bin/doku.php?id=content tab to strengthen semantic understanding. Regardless, the argument is trivial and Forms are powerful regardless of which admin-side vector you access them.

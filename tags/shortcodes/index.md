# Shortcode examples

Beginning in Textpattern 4.7.0, you can use the new [short-tags and shortcodes](short-tags-and-shortcodes) functionality to create reusable partials of markup that define things like content elements, widgets, and so forth, then make use of them by adding a simple, custom tag in your articles instead of lengthy, complex blocks of raw HTML.

(The idea is similar to functionality previously provided by the smd_macro plugin, which this new core functionality now makes obsolete.)

Following are shortcodes you can put to use immediately in a 4.7.0 installation of Textpattern. Everyone is welcome to contribute new shortcodes for community benefit. Each shortcode example must be its own documentation page.

### Available shortcodes

* [Image with caption shortcode](image-with-caption-shortcode) (one possible use of HTML `figure` element; pulls data from a Textpattern image)
* [Aside-quote shortcode](aside-quote-shortcode) (one possible use of HTML `aside` element; similar to a pullquote, but pulls data from a Textpattern link)
* [Download link shortcode](download-link-shortcode) (a file download link/widget)
* [Video embed shortcode](video-embed-shortcode) (to embed a video in article)

h1. Variable

h2. Syntax

bc. <txp:variable />

The *variable* tag is both a _single_ and a _container_ tag which sets or returns a user-defined global variable.

If used as a _container_ tag, the result of the contained statements are assigned to the given variable @name@, like this:

bc. <txp:variable>
    ...contained statements...
</txp:variable>

p(alert-block information). Note: Avoid entering white space characters for better code readability between the opening and closing _variable_ tags, they will lead to falsified results in the "if_variable":if-variable evaluation.

h2. Attributes

Tag will accept the following attributes (*case-sensitive*):

* @name="text"@
The variable name for which you wish to assign a value. Valid variable names must not contain any single or double quotes.
* @value="value"@
(Optionally) define the value to which you wish to set the variable. Without this attribute, the tag returns the current value assigned to the named variable.

h2. Examples

h3. Example 1: Store site-wide constants

Allows you to define constants at a single location (e.g., a [[Form]] template, or even at the top of a [[Page]] template) and use them elsewhere later on.

Somewhere at the very beginning of a template you would define names and values, just like you do on your desktop calculatorâ€™s “memory” keys:

bc. <txp:if_search>
    <title>My blog search results: <txp:search_term /></title>
    <meta name="description" content="Blog article search results.">
    <meta name="robots" content="none">
<txp:else />
    <txp:if_category>
        <title>Blog category: <txp:category title="1" /></title>
        <meta name="description" content="Blog article ‘<txp:category title="1" />’ category archive.">
        <meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow, noodp, noydir">
    <txp:else />
        <title>My blog homepage</title>
        <meta name="description" content="The great homepage of my great blog.">
        <meta name="robots" content="index, follow, noodp, noydir">
        <txp:variable name="homepage" value="1" />
    </txp:if_category>
</txp:if_search>

Later down the [[Page]] template or in a separate [[Form]] you can read the attribute values previously set onditionals come in handy at times:

bc. <txp:if_variable name="homepage" value="1">
    ...homepage content...
</txp:if_variable>

Other tags used: "else":else, "if_category":if-category, "if_search":if-search, "if_variable":if-variable, "search_term":search-term.

h3. Example 2: Use any tag's value as a conditional expression

There are two parts to making this work. First a variable is created that stores the output of any tag as the @value@ (the @name@ is arbitrary)...

bc. <txp:variable name="foo" value='<txp:permlink />' />

p(alert-block information). Note: A Textpattern tag, used as an attribute (a parsed attribute), must be surrounded with single quotes.

The variable 'foo' can then be used as a conditional later in the code.

bc. <txp:if_variable name="foo" value="example.com/bar/baz">
    ...do this...
</txp:if_variable>

The conditional is saying if there is a variable named 'foo' having a specific value of 'example.com/bar/baz', then output what is defined, i.e., 'do this'.

Other tags used: "if_variable":if-variable.

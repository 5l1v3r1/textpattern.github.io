h3. Example: Inner content

Given the following form named @example_form@:

bc. <div>
    This content is static and will be the same every time this form is invoked.
    <txp:yield />
</div>

We can invoke it twice with different inner content each time:

bc. <txp:output_form form="example_form">
    Invoking 'example_form' with some inner content.
</txp:output_form>
<txp:output_form form="example_form">
    Invoking 'example_form' again, this time with different inner content.
</txp:output_form>

And the result will be:

bc. <div>
    This content is static and will be the same every time this form is invoked.
    Invoking 'example_form' with some inner content.
</div>
<div>
    This content is static and will be the same every time this form is invoked.
    Invoking 'example_form' again, this time with different inner content.
</div>

Other tags used: "output_form":output-form.

# Textpattern brand and voice

The following resources (more are in development) are used by the Textpattern project for all of its platforms and associated content. We are grateful if you use these resources too, where reasonable, whenever you write, speak, or present about Textpattern.

## Project-wide resources

These baseline resources are used across all Textpattern platforms and project initiatives. Thus must be followed in all cases.

**Writing and editorial guidelines**

* [Editorial style guide](https://docs.textpattern.com/brand/editorial-style-guide): Baseline guidelines for all written content.

**Visual identity**

* [Brand logomark and logotext](https://docs.textpattern.com/brand/textpattern-logopack.zip) (Zip file) 

## Platform-specific resources

These resources are extensions of the baseline resources. Use these in addition to the baselines, respective to the platform or project you are working on.

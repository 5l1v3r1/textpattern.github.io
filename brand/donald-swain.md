# Donald Swain

When Textpattern CMS is installed with its default content, a welcome article is published with a comment from Donald Swain. The article and Donald's comment ("I enjoy your site very much.") can be deleted if desired with no adverse side effects.

This article comment is published whether site commenting functionality is enabled or disabled and it originates from `127.0.0.1`, a typical localhost loopback IP address. The existence of the comment is *not* an indication that your server has been compromised, it's purely an example or demonstration comment.

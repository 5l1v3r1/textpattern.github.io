# Donald Swain

When Textpattern CMS is installed with its default content, a welcome article is published along with a comment from Donald Swain. Donald's comment ("I enjoy your site very much.") and can be deleted if desired with no adverse side-effects. The same is true of the default article.

This comment is published whether site commenting is enabled or disabled and originates from `127.0.0.1`, a typical localhost loopback IP address. The existence of the comment is *not* an indication that your server has been compromised, it's purely an example or demonstration comment.
